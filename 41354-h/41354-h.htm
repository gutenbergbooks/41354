<h2>THE INCREDIBLE
HONEYMOON</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BEGINNING</div>


<div class='cap'>TO understand this story you will have to
believe in the Greater Gods&mdash;Love and Youth,
for example, and Adventure and Coincidence; also
in the trusting heart of woman and the deceitful
spirit of man. You will have to reconcile yourself
to the fact that though daily you go to London
by the nine-seven, returning by the five-fifteen,
and have your accustomed meals at eight, one,
and half-past six, there are those who take neither
trains nor meals regularly. That, while nothing
on earth ever happens to you, there really are on
earth people to whom things do happen. Nor is
the possibility of such happenings wholly a matter
of the independent income&mdash;the income for which
you do not work. It is a matter of the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
soul. I knew a man whose parents had placed
him in that paralyzing sort of situation which is
symbolized by the regular trains and the regular
meals. It was quite a nice situation for some
people, a situation, too, in which one was certain
to "get on." But the man I knew had other
dreams. He chucked his job, one fine Saturday
morning in May, went for a long walk, met a
tinker and bought his outfit&mdash;a wheel on wheels,
a sort of barrow with a grindstone on it, and a pot
for putting fire in dangling underneath. This he
wheeled profitably through rural districts&mdash;so
profitably that he was presently able to buy a
donkey and a cart, and to sell kettles as well as
mend them. He has since bought a gipsy tent;
with these impediments&mdash;or helps&mdash;he travels
through the pleasant country. Things are always
happening to him. He has found a buried treasure;
frustrated a burglary; once he rescued a
lady in distress; and another time he killed a man.
The background to these dramatic incidents is
always the pleasant background of quiet road,
blossoming hedgerows and orchards, corn-fields
and meadows and lanes. He says this is the way
to live. I will write down his story some day,
but this is not it. I only bring him in to illustrate
my point, which is that adventures do happen&mdash;to
the adventurous.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>My friend the tinker has had, perhaps, more
than his share of adventures, but then his is the
temperament that shoots, like a willing needle,
to the great magnet of melodrama. The temperamental
needle of Edward Basingstoke followed
the magnet of romance. In a gayer, if less comfortable,
age he might have been a knight-errant,
or, at least, the sympathetic squire of a knight-errant.
Had he been born in the days when most
people stayed at home and minded their own
business he would have insisted on going out and
minding other people's. Living in the days of
aeroplanes, motors, telegraphy, and cinematographs,
in a world noisy with the nonsense of
politics and the press, he told himself that the
ideal life was the life of the farmer who plowed
and sowed and reaped, tended his beasts and
filled his barns, and went home from his clean,
quiet work to the open hearth whence the wood
smoke curled up to heaven like the smoke of an
altar.</p>

<p>Destiny, in deep perversity, was making an
engineer of him. He dreamed his pastoral dreams
in the deafening clangor of the shops at Crewe,
but not ten thousand hammers could beat out of
his brain the faith that life was really&mdash;little as
one might suppose it, just looking at it from
Crewe&mdash;full of the most beautiful and delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
possibilities, and that, somehow or other, people
got from life what they chose to take. While he
was making up his mind what he should take, he
went on learning his trade. And Destiny seemed
determined that he should learn nothing else.
What we call Destiny is really Chance&mdash;and so
far from being immutable, she is the veriest flirt
and weathercock. She changed her mind about
Edward&mdash;or perhaps Death, who is stronger than
she, insisted and prevailed.</p>

<p>Just at the time when a faint dust was beginning
to settle on his dreams&mdash;the sort of dust that
thickens and hardens into clay and you grow
cabbages in it&mdash;Death intervened to save him.
It was his uncle who died, and he left a will, and
by that will certain property came to Edward.
When the news came he took a day to think of it,
and he went to the works as usual that afternoon
and the next morning. But next day at noon he
laid down his tools and never took them up again.
Instead he took a ticket to Oxford, appeared at the
rooms of his friend, whom he surprised in slumber,
and told his tale.</p>

<p>"And you're going to chuck the shop," said the
friend, whose name was Vernon Martingale, and
his father a baronet.</p>

<p>"I have chucked the shop," said Edward. "I
chucked it at Fate as you might throw a stone at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a dog. And that reminds me&mdash;I want a dog. Do
you know of a nice dog&mdash;intelligent, good manners,
self-respecting, and worthy?"</p>

<p>"Any particular breed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. These researches into family
history are in the worst possible taste. You don't
love me for my pedigree. Why should I love my
dog for his?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you want some tea, anyhow," said
Martingale.</p>

<p>So they had tea, and talked cricket.</p>

<p>"Any idea what you mean to do?" Martingale
asked several times, and at last Edward answered
him.</p>

<p>"What I mean to do," he said, "is what I
always meant to do. I mean to be a farmer, and
hunt, and shoot, and grow flowers. I think I shall
specialize on sunflowers. They're so satisfying."</p>

<p>"More than you are," said Vernon. "Mean to
say you're going to buy a farm and ruin yourself
the moment you've got a few half-crowns to ruin
yourself with?"</p>

<p>"I am going to be a farmer," said Basingstoke,
"but first I am going to see life."</p>

<p>"Life? But you were always so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"I mean <em>that</em>"&mdash;Edward indicated the sunshine
outside&mdash;"not getting drunk and being disreputable.
I can't think why the deuce-dickens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that sort of beastliness is always called seeing life.
As if life were all gas, and wining, and electric
light, and the things you don't talk about before
ladies. No, my boy, I'm going out into the unknown&mdash;not
into the night, because it happens to
be afternoon&mdash;and I thought I'd just come and
clasp that hand and gaze once into those eyes
before I set my foot on the untrodden path of
adventure. Farewell, Vernon of Martingale, good
knight and true! Who knows when we shall meet
again?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't, anyhow," said Vernon, "and that's
why you're not going till the day after to-morrow,
and why I insist on knowing what you mean by
seeing life&mdash;and why you're going to stay till
to-morrow, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid that I should criticize another
man's tastes," Edward sighed, "or deprive him of
any innocent enjoyment. If you want me to
stay&mdash;well, I'll stay&mdash;till to-morrow. And as for
what I mean by seeing life&mdash;well, I should have
thought even you would have understood that.
I'm going to get a stick, and a knapsack, and a
dog, and a different kind of hat, and some very
large boots with nails, and a new suit, only I shall
wear it all night before I wear it all day. Oh,
Vernon, can't you guess my simple secret?"</p>

<p>"He calls a walking-tour seeing life!" Vernon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
pointed out. "And who's going with you and where
are you going? The Hartz Mountains?&mdash;the Carpathians?&mdash;Margate?&mdash;Trouville?
What?"</p>

<p>"The person who is going with me," said Edward,
"is the dog whom we haven't yet bought.
Come along out and buy him. As to where I'm
going, I shall follow the most ancient of sign-posts&mdash;and
I know that I can't go wrong."</p>

<p>"You will follow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My nose," Edward explained, kindly&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"That indicator of the place to be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Heaven-sent guide to beauty and to thee.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Do you know, if you talk rot to the chaps at
the works they try to understand what you mean.
Like Scotchmen, you know. They think they can
understand anything, no matter how shallow.
Now I will say for you that you know your limitations.
Let's buy the dog, my son, and get a
canoe."</p>

<p>They did. And the dog upset the canoe.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MAKING AN AEROPLANE</div>


<div class='cap'>THE Five Bells was asleep; asleep, at least, was
the face with which it met the world. In the
brick-floored kitchen, out of sight and hearing of
the road, the maid was singing as she sluiced the
bricks with a white mop; but if she and her mop
had been state secrets, matters of life and death,
they could not have been more safely hidden from
any chance passer. In the bar the landlord was
asleep behind the <cite>Lewes Gazette and South Coast
Journal</cite>. In the parlor the landlady was asleep
behind a screen of geraniums and campanulas.
The ornamental clock on the mantelpiece said,
most untruly, ten minutes to eight. Really it
was four o'clock, the sleepiest hour in the day.
The flies buzzed in the parlor window; in the bar
the wasps buzzed in the bottle that had seemed
so sweet a bourn to each as it drifted in from the
out-of-door heat to the cool darkness of the
sanded bar.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>On the broad, white door-step the old cat slept,
his person nicely adjusted to the sun and shade,
his flanks in the sunshine and his head in the
shadow of the porch. The white blind of the
window swelled out, now and then, like a sail, because
in this sort of weather one leaves all doors
and windows open. In the yard some one had
drawn a bucket of water&mdash;the brown oak and the
brown iron of the bucket were still wet, and still
wet the trail it had made where it was carried to
the old bath that the chickens drank from. But
the trail was drying quickly, and the hens, having
had their drink, had gone to sleep in the hollows
they had scooped for themselves in the dust of
their inclosure. Some one had been chopping
wood, for a few chips lay round the block, in
which the bill was stuck by its sharp edge. The
man who attended to the wood and water was
asleep, standing against the ladder that led from
the stable to the hay-loft&mdash;a convenient position,
and, if you were wanted in a hurry, not compromising,
as lying down would be.</p>

<p>To right and left the road stretched, very white
and shining, between dusty hedgerows and scattered
cottages whose drawn blinds looked like
the eyelids of sleepers. The whole village was
asleep, it seemed&mdash;only a boy and a dog were
awake. The boy had not gone to school because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he had torn his every-day trousers on a nail in
the stable. To wear his Sunday trousers was, of
course, out of the question. And to mend the
every-day trousers would take time. So Tommy
was put to bed, nominally as a punishment for
not looking where he was going&mdash;a most unfair
implication, for the nail had attacked him in the
rear. Children do not go to sleep when they are
put to bed as a punishment. They cry, if their
spirit has been broken by unkindness; if not, they
lie and meditate mischief. Tommy waited till
the afternoon silence settled on the house, and
then very carefully and slowly crept down the
stairs in his nightshirt, dodged Gladys and the
mop, and reached the larder. Here he secured a
flead-cake, a raisin-cake, and an apple, dodged
Gladys again, and reached the back door, where
he stood looking out at the yard. It would be
silly to go back to bed. Mother would not be
awake for a good half-hour yet. There would be
time to get to the stable, climb into the loft, and
eat his booty there. It would be safer, in one way,
and in another more adventurous.</p>

<p>He stooped till his head was below the kitchen
window and crept by, skirting the walls of the
yard till he reached the stable door, and next moment
was safe in the half-darkness where the sunlight
through the cracks of the door made dusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
shafts of radiance. The familiar smell of hay and
horses charmed him, as it always did. Ah, there
was Robert, asleep as usual. Well, even if Robert
woke, he could be trusted not to tell. Tommy
climbed into the manger of one of the empty
stalls, and just as he got his knee on it some one
behind pushed him with sudden and incredible
violence. He fell heavily, dropped his plunder,
and found himself involved in the enthusiastic
embraces of a large, strange, white dog, which in
one breathless instant licked his face all over,
trampled on his stomach, made two mouthfuls of
the flead-cake and the raisin-cake, rolled the apple
in the muck of the stable, snorted in a sort of brutal
ecstasy, and bolted heavily out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>It was too much. The sudden and brutal attack
overcame all considerations of prudence.
Tommy forgot where he was, and why; the dangers
of his situation were nothing beside the outrage
of this unprovoked assault and theft. Robert
was awakening slowly. If he had been awake before
he might have repulsed the enemy. Tommy
opened his mouth to howl, but the howl changed
to a scream, for there was the dog back again,
snuffing loudly in the straw and fawning at
Tommy as on an old and valued friend.</p>

<p>"Charles!" a stern voice called from the yard,
"come here, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The dog wagged a muscular tail and grinned
at Tommy, as though inviting him to share the
joke. The stable door was darkened by a form.
Even in the difficulties of repulsing the dog's attention
without irritating it, the child found time
to be glad that the darkening form was that of a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Call him off, if he's your dog," Tommy urged,
thickly, backing against the manger.</p>

<p>"Might as well call him off, sir," Robert&mdash;now
almost awake&mdash;conceded.</p>

<p>The stranger stepped forward, a snap clicked,
and Charles, still widely smiling, was straining at
the end of a leathern thong.</p>

<p>"I hope he didn't frighten you," said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"He bunted at me with his great head," said
Tommy, with half a sob, "and then he eat up
what I'd got, and hooked it off again afore you
could say knife."</p>

<p>"What had you got?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Tommy, remembering caution,
"at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The jingling of the guinea heals," said the
stranger, incomprehensibly. "Would sixpence be
any comfort to you?"</p>

<p>Tommy's eyes answered, and the stranger held
it out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tommy, and added, in
close imitation of his father's manner to thirsty
travelers, "Going far to-day, sir?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said the stranger, "of putting
up here."</p>

<p>"Then," said Tommy, with great presence of
mind, "please don't say anything to them about
the dog eating&mdash;what he did eat&mdash;nor me being
here in my shirt, nor about Robert being asleep.
If you'll go round to the front, sir, you'll find the
bar, and that'll give me a chance to slip back to
bed, sir, if you'd be so kind."</p>

<p>"I see," said the stranger, "you were sent to
bed."</p>

<p>"In punishment like," said Tommy, "so you
see I don't want to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Exactly. An unobserved retreat. I will draw
the enemy's fire from the front premises. Come,
Charles."</p>

<p>Charles obeyed, only pausing to entangle the
lead in the handle of a shovel and to bring this
down upon the feet of Robert, to upset a sieve of
chaff and run between his master's legs with a
sudden violence which, but for the support of
the door-post, would have thrown him to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Nice-spoken young man," said Robert. "Now,
young Tommy, you cut along back where you belong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I'll be asking Gladys the time to keep her
off of the back door while you slips in, you young
limb."</p>

<p>He strolled across to the window as Tommy's
bare feet trod the sun-warmed bricks to the back
door. As the child crept up the stairs he heard
the stranger's voice in the bar.</p>

<p>"Sixpence," said Tommy, in ecstasy, "and him
going to put up here." He cuddled down into his
bed well satisfied with the afternoon's adventure.
Adventures are, indeed, to the adventurous.</p>

<p>"If I'd 'a' bin a good boy and stayed in bed
nothing wouldn't have happened," was how he
put it to himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the stranger, encumbered by the
striving Charles, was "being shown the rooms"&mdash;the
bare, much-scrubbed bedroom, the all-too-full
and too-carpeted parlor.</p>

<p>"They are exactly what I want," he said, and
so won the heart of his hostess.</p>

<p>When Tommy, his trousers restored, came down
to tea he was warned not to go clamping about in
his boots, because there was a gentleman in the
parlor. Tommy fingered the sixpence in his
pocket and said nothing; his mouth was, indeed,
far too full for words.</p>

<p>That evening in the parched orchard behind the
house Tommy came edging shyly toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stranger as he lounged under the trees smoking
a fat pipe.</p>

<p>"Hullo, young man!" was the greeting. "Come
here and talk to me."</p>

<p>Tommy dumbly drew near.</p>

<p>"Got your trousers back, I see," said the
stranger, genially.</p>

<p>Tommy admitted it with a grunt. The stranger
nodded and took his pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Ever see a pig?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tommy grunted again.</p>

<p>"I see you have. You speak their language
awfully well." The stranger uttered a sound
which Tommy recognized and smiled to hear.
"That's what the pigs say," said the stranger.
"Agreeable little boys who have recovered their
trousers say 'Yes' or 'No' when their friends ask
them questions. Don't they?"</p>

<p>"I dun'no'," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do. Because I've told you. Now
what would you like to do?"</p>

<p>"I dun'no'."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that you know, because I
don't know myself. But I'll put it to you like
this: If you can make up your mind to talk the
language of agreeable little boys who have recovered
their trousers, I am disposed to endure your
company and even to assist you in any play you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
may have in hand. But I can't associate with a
person who grunts at me. If you want to grunt,
go and grunt at some one who likes it. I don't."</p>

<p>"I didn't go for to," Tommy urged.</p>

<p>"Handsomely admitted. I accept your apology.
You don't know what you'd like to do, I
say. Well, is there anything you'd like to <em>have?</em>
I'm living the idle life, Tommy, and my hands are
beginning to ache for want of something to do.
I want to make something. Ever make anything?"</p>

<p>"I made a rabbit-hutch, onst," Tommy owned,
"but the door warn't straight on her hinges. And
I tried a kite&mdash;but it stuck to me and come to bits
afore ever it was dry."</p>

<p>"Look here," said the stranger, sitting up,
"what about a kite? I could make you a kite as
big as a house or a fire-balloon. Would you like
that?"</p>

<p>Tommy began a grunt, pretended that it had
been a cough, and turned that into, "Yes, please,
sir."</p>

<p>"We must restrain Charles," said the stranger,
turning to the large white dog, who sat with feet
firmly planted, smiling a wide, pink smile, "or this
kite will certainly stick to <em>him</em> and come to pieces
afore <em>it's</em> dry. Where's the shop?"</p>

<p>"Down street," said Tommy. "I could pop
down street in a minute for the paper and things."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure you'd rather have a kite than anything
else?"</p>

<p>Tommy hesitated, and then said of course he'd
rather have a hairyplane, but he supposed the
stranger couldn't.</p>

<p>To which the stranger startlingly replied, "Oh,
couldn't I, my boy! Father got a horse and
trap?" he went on. And from that moment
the most wonderful four days of Tommy's life
moved forward majestically without pause or
let.</p>

<p>To drive into Eastbourne with the gentleman&mdash;rather
slow the old horse was, but it was the best
trap&mdash;to hold the reins outside important and unusual
shops, including the Eastbourne Motor-Car
Company and the telegraph-office at the station;
to be taken to dinner at a fine hotel with flowers
in all the windows, and real waiters dressed exactly
like the gentlemen who sang at the school concert,
white ties and all&mdash;or just like the butler at Mr.
Ferney's who had the training-stables&mdash;and such
things to eat as Tommy "never did."</p>

<p>The horse and trap were put up at Mr. Pettigrew's
Livery and Bait Stables, in itself an act of
unheard-of daring and extravagance. And after
dinner the stranger got a motor-car&mdash;a real private
one&mdash;none of your red flags and mustn't ride
on the front seat, where, in fact, he and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
stranger did, with great dash and daring, actually
ride. And they went to Pevensy and Hurstmonceau
and Hastings, and the stranger told Tommy
stories about the places, so that history was never
quite itself again to Tommy. Then back to Eastbourne,
to call again at the unusual shops, as well
as at one of the more usual character, where the
stranger bought toffee and buns and cake and
peppermint creams; to get a parcel from the station,
and so home round the feet of the downs in
the pleasant-colored evening, with the dust white
on the hedges, and the furze in flower, and the skylarks
singing "fit to bu'st theirselves," as Tommy
pointed out when the stranger called his attention
to the little, dark, singing specks against the clear
sky, the old white horse going at a spanking pace.
No one would have believed he had it in him,
compared to what he was in the morning; and
drawing up very short and sharp in front of the
porch&mdash;no driving into the yard and just calling
for Robert&mdash;and father himself coming out to take
the reins. Oh, that was a day!</p>

<p>To the stranger, also, whose name, it will surprise
you little to learn, was Edward Basingstoke,
the home-coming was not without charm. The
day before he had been welcomed as a guest; now
he was welcomed as a friend, one who had taken
Tommy for an outing and spent money on him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
like water. Any one could see that from the parcels
the child had his arms full of.</p>

<p>Robert in the stable, hearing the return, and
heartened by the unmistakable attitude of the
family, loosened Charles from the taut chain at
whose end he had choked all day, and sent him
flying like a large white bullet into the bar, where
his master was standing. Charles knocked over a
table and three glasses, trod on the edge of a
spittoon and upset it, and the landlord said it
didn't matter! Could any reception have been
more warmly welcoming?</p>

<p>It charmed Edward so much that he said,
"When Tommy's face is washed, might he have
tea with me to finish up the day?"</p>

<p>And this, too, happened. And after tea, when
Charles had been partially calmed by five whole
buns, eaten in five eager mouthfuls, they undid
the parcels, and Tommy reveled in the tools and
metals, the wood, the canvas, the dozen other
things he knew neither the names nor the uses of.
And when it was time to say good night and they
had said it, Tommy wanted to say something else.
He stood by the parlor door, shuffling his boots
and looking with blue, adoring eyes at the stranger.</p>

<p>"I say," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, what <em>do</em> you say?"</p>

<p>"I say," was still all that Tommy said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I hear you do. But what?"</p>

<p>"I'm right-down glad you come here to stay,
instead of going on to Wilmington, like what you
might have," was the most Tommy could do.
Then he added, after a fierce, brief struggle between
affection and shyness: "I do take it very
kind, sir&mdash;and the peppermints, and all. Good
night, sir."</p>

<p>It was the happiest day Edward had spent since
he left Crewe.</p>

<p>And next day they began to make the aeroplane.
I do not know how toy aeroplanes are
made. There may be a hundred ways of making
them. If there are, Mr. Basingstoke knew at least
one of these ways, and it was quite a good way,
too. The village carpenter and the village blacksmith
each was visited&mdash;I know that&mdash;and a good
deal of the work was done at the carpenter's bench.
And at the end of the third day the toy was ready.</p>

<p>"We'll fly it in the morning," said Mr. Basingstoke.
"Are you glad it's done? Sure you
wouldn't have liked a kite better?"</p>

<p>"Not by long chalks," was Tommy's fervent
answer.</p>

<p>The little aeroplane sat on the little stand the
carpenter had made for it, shiny with varnish,
white with canvas, glittering in all its metal
mysteries.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jiminy!" said Tommy, awe-stricken at his own
good fortune, "I didn't know anybody could be
so clever as what you are."</p>

<p>Edward Basingstoke, as he went to bed, wondered
whether, after all, he could spend his money
to any better purpose than going about the
country making aeroplanes to please little boys.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EDEN</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN you have made an aeroplane, the next
thing is to make it fly. And however agreeable
an admiring audience may be while one is
fiddling with definite and concrete objects of
wood, canvas, and metal, one is apt, for the flight
itself&mdash;the great flight, the flight by which the
aeroplane shall stand or fall&mdash;to desire solitude.</div>

<p>That was why Edward drew the yellow blind
up and the dimity curtain aside and turned his
bed round, so that the sun at its first rising should
strike through his dreams and awaken him. The
sun did exactly what it was expected to do, and
Edward awoke saying "Bother" before he remembered
that "Bother" was not at all what he
meant. Then he got up and splashed gently, so
as not to break the audible sleep of the people in
the next room, stole down the creaking, twisted
stairs in his tennis-shoes, soft-footed as a cat,
drew the bolts of the back door, and slipped out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
closing the door noiselessly behind him. He was
careful to draw the bolt into its place again by
means of a bit of fishing-line. You can do this
quite easily with an old door that does not fit
very closely&mdash;if you are careful to mark with
chalk on the outside of the door, as Edward did,
the exact place where the bolt is. Having thus
secured the door against passing tramps or burglars,
he went out across the highroad, soft with
thick, white dust, where the dew lay on hedge and
grassy border, and the sun made diamonds of the
dew. Charles, choking himself in the stable, grew
faint with distance.</p>

<p>Beyond the village was a meadow suited to his
needs. It was bordered on one side by a high
red-brick wall, above whose moss-grown coping
the rounded shapes of trees leaned. A wood
edged it on two other sides, and in the front was
a road.</p>

<p>Here he made his preparations, wound up his
machine, and, after one or two false starts, got it
going. He meant to fly it like a kite, and to this
end he had tied one end of a ball of fine twine to
the middle of its body. Now he raised it above
his head and launched it. The little creature
rose like a bird; the ball of string leaped and
jumped between his feet, as he paid out the line;
the whirring wings hung poised a second, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
level of the tree-tops, and then, caught by the
wind, sailed straight toward the red wall, burrowed
into the trees, and stopped. He ran toward the
wall, winding up the string, and stood below,
looking up. He could not see the winged loose
thing. He tweaked the string and his tweak was
met with uncompromising resistance. The aeroplane
had stuck in a chestnut-tree, and hung there,
buzzing.</p>

<p>Edward measured the wall with his eye. It was
an old wall, of soft red brick, from which the mortar
had fallen away. In its crannies moss grew,
and ragged-robin and ground-ivy hung their delicate
veil in the angles of its buttresses&mdash;little
ferns and wall-flowers run to seed marked its
courses, the yellow snapdragon which English
children call toad-flax flaunted its pure sulphur-colored
plumes from the ledge below the coping.
An architect would have said that the wall wanted
pointing; a builder would have pointed it&mdash;an
artist would have painted it. To an engineer in
grief for a lost toy the wall presented itself as an
obstacle to be climbed. He climbed it.</p>

<p>He thrust the string into his jacket pocket, and
presently set hand and foot to the hold that the
worn wall afforded. In half a minute he was
astride the coping; next moment he had swung by
his hands and let himself go on the wall's other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
side. It was a longer drop than he expected; it
jarred him a little, and his hat tumbled off. As
he picked this up he noticed that the wall on the
inside had been newly pointed. The trees were a
good thirty feet from the wall. There would be
no getting back by the way he had come. He
must find a gate. Meantime the little aeroplane's
buzzing had grown faint and ceased. But the
twine led him to the tree, as the silken clue led
Queen Eleanor to the tower of Fair Rosamond.
The next thing was to climb the tree and bring
down the truant toy.</p>

<p>The park spread smooth and green before him&mdash;the
green smoothness that comes only to English
grass growing where grass has been these many
years. Quiet trees dotted the smooth greenness&mdash;thickening
about the house, whose many chimneys,
red and twisted, rose smokeless above the clustered
green. Nothing moved in all the park,
where the sun drank the dew; birds stirred and
twittered in the branches&mdash;that was all. The
little aeroplane had stopped its buzzing. Edward
was moved to thank Fate that he had not brought
Charles. Also he was glad that this trespass of
his had happened so early. He would get down
the aeroplane and quietly go out by the lodge
gate. Even if locked, it would be climbable.</p>

<p>The chestnut-tree, however, had to be climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
first. It was easy enough, though the leaves baffled
him a little, so that it was some time before he
saw the desired gleam of metal and canvas among
the dappled foliage. Also, it was not quite easy
to get the thing down without injuring it, and one
had to go slowly.</p>

<p>He lowered it, at last, by its string to the
ground from the lowest branch, then moved along
a little, hung by his hands, and dropped.</p>

<p>He picked up the toy and turned to go. "Oh!"
he said, without meaning to. And, "I beg your
pardon," without quite knowing what for.</p>

<p>Because, as he turned he came face to face with
a vision, the last one would have expected to see
in an English park at early day. A girl in a
Burmese coat, red as poppies, with gold-embroidered
hem a foot deep. Her dress was white. Her
eyes were dark, her face palely bright, and behind
her dark head a golden-green Japanese umbrella
made a great ridged halo.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Edward again, and
understood that it was because he was, after all,
trespassing.</p>

<p>"I should think you did," said the vision,
crossly. "What on earth do you mean by it?
How did you get in?"</p>

<p>Edward, standing a little awkwardly with the
aeroplane in his hands, looked toward the wall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came over after this," he said. "I'm very
sorry. I was flying the thing and it stuck in the
tree. If you'll tell me the way to the lodge, I'll&mdash;I
hope I didn't scare you."</p>

<p>"I couldn't think what it was," she answered, a
little less crossly. "I saw the tree tossing about
as if&mdash;as if it had gone mad."</p>

<p>"And you thought of dryads and hastened to
the spot. And it was only an idiot and his aeroplane.
I say&mdash;I <em>am</em> sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't help not being a dryad," she said,
and now she smiled, and her smile transformed
her face as sunlight does a landscape. "What I
really thought you were was a tramp. Only tramps
never climb trees. I couldn't think how you got
in here, though. Tramps never climb walls.
They get in sometimes through the oak fence
beyond the plantations."</p>

<p>"It was very intrepid of you to face a tramp,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I love tramps," she said; "they're always
quite nice to you if you don't bully them or patronize
them. There were two jolly ones last week,
and I talked to them, and they made tea out in
the road, you know, and gave me a cup over the
fence. It <em>was</em> nasty." She shuddered a little.
"But I liked it awfully, all the same," she added.
"I wish I were a tramp."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not a bad life," said he.</p>

<p>"It's <em>the</em> life," she said, enthusiastically. "No
ties, no responsibilities&mdash;no nasty furniture and
hateful ornaments&mdash;you just go where you like
and do what you like; and when you don't like
where you are, you go somewhere else; and when
you don't like what you're doing, you needn't
go on doing it."</p>

<p>"Those are very irresponsible sentiments&mdash;for a
lady."</p>

<p>"I know. That's why I think it's so dull being
a woman. Men can do whatever they want to."</p>

<p>"Only if they haven't their living to earn," said
Edward, not quite so much to himself as he would
have liked.</p>

<p>There was a little pause, and then, still less
himself, he blundered into, "I say, it is jolly of
you to talk to me like this."</p>

<p>She froze at once. "I forgot," she said, "that
we had not been introduced. Thank you for reminding
me."</p>

<p>Edward's better self was now wholly lost, and
what was left of him could find nothing better to
answer than, "Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>"What I ought to have said," she went on, her
face a mask of cold politeness, "is that you can't
possibly get out by the lodge. There are fierce
dogs. And the lodge-keepers are worse than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dogs. If you will follow me&mdash;at a distance, for
fear I should begin to talk to you again&mdash;I'll show
you where the gardener's ladder is, and you can
put it up against the wall and get out that
way."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I get out where the tramps get in?"
he asked, humbly. "I don't like to trouble you."</p>

<p>"Not from here. We should have to pass close
by the house."</p>

<p>The "we" gave him courage. "I say&mdash;do forgive
me," he said.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive," said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, but do," he said, "if you'd only see it!
It was just because it was so wonderful and splendid
to have met you like this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to have
you talk to me as you do to the other tramps."</p>

<p>"You're not a tramp," she said, "and I ought
not to have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"But I am," said he, "it's just what I really
and truly am."</p>

<p>"Come and get the ladder," said she, and moved
toward the wall.</p>

<p>"Not unless you forgive me. I won't," he
added, plucking up a little spirit, "be indebted
for ladders to people who won't forgive a man because
he speaks the truth clumsily."</p>

<p>"Come," she said, looking back over her
shoulder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he said, obstinately, not moving. "Not
unless you forgive me."</p>

<p>"It can't possibly matter to you whether I
forgive you or not," she turned to say it. And as
she spoke there came to Edward quite suddenly
and quite unmistakably the knowledge that it
did matter. Sometimes glimpses do thus suddenly
and strangely come to us&mdash;and that by some
magic inner light that is not reason we know things
that by the light of reason we could never know.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "I'll go after that ladder
in a minute. But first I've got something to say
to you. Don't be angry, because I've got to say
it. Do you know that just now&mdash;just before I
said that stupid thing that offended you&mdash;you
were talking to me as though you'd known me all
your life?"</p>

<p>"You needn't rub it in," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you know why that is? It's because you
<em>are</em> going to know me all your life. I'm perfectly
certain of it. Somehow or other, it's true. We're
going to be friends. I sha'n't need to say again
how jolly it is of you to talk to me. We shall take
all that as a matter of course. People aren't
pitchforked into meetings like this for nothing.
I'm glad I said that. I'm glad you were angry
with me for saying it. If you hadn't I might just
have gone away and not known till I got outside&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
then it would have been a deuce and all of
a business to get hold of you again. But now I
know. And you know, too. When shall I see you
again? Never mind about forgiving me. Just
tell me when I shall see you again. And then I'll
go."</p>

<p>"You must be mad," was all she could find to
say. She had furled her sunshade and was
smoothing its bamboo ribs with pink fingers.</p>

<p>"You'll be able to find out whether I'm mad,
you know, when you see me again. As a matter
of fact&mdash;which seems maddest, when you meet
some one you want to talk to, to go away without
talking or to insist on talk and more talk? And
you can't say you didn't want to talk to me, because
you know you did. Look here, meet me
to-morrow morning again&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry if you don't. We're like two
travelers who have collected all sorts of wonderful
things in foreign countries. We long to show each
other our collections&mdash;all the things we've thought
and dreamed. If we'd been what you call introduced,
perhaps we shouldn't have found this out.
But as it is, we know it."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, seriously. "I will. Will
you sit down for ten minutes? This tree-root was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
made for you to sit down on for ten minutes, and
I will speak for myself."</p>

<p>"I can't," she said, and her voice&mdash;there was
hurry in it, and indecision, but the ice had gone.
"You must come at once for that ladder. It's
getting more dangerous every moment. If any
one saw you here there'd be an awful row."</p>

<p>"For you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for me. Come on."</p>

<p>He followed her along the wall under the chestnuts.
There was no more spoken words till they
came to the ladder.</p>

<p>Then, "Right," he said. "Thank you. Good-by."
And set the ladder against the wall.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said she. "I'll hand the aeroplane
up to you?"</p>

<p>"Stand clear," he said, half-way up the ladder.
"I'll give it a sideways tip from the top&mdash;it'll fall
into its place. It's too heavy for you to lift.
Good-by."</p>

<p>He had reached the top of the wall. She stood
below, looking up at him.</p>

<p>"There won't be any row now?"</p>

<p>"No. It's quite safe."</p>

<p>"Then have you nothing to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Yes, I have. I will come to-morrow.
You'll misunderstand everything if I don't."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>She came up the ladder, two steps, then handed
him his toy. Then the ladder fell with a soft thud
among the moss and earth and dead leaves; his
head showed a moment above the wall, then
vanished.</p>

<p>He went thoughtfully through the dewy grass,
along the road, and back to his inn.</p>

<p>Tommy met him by the horse-trough. "You
been flying it?" he asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes. She went like a bird."</p>

<p>"How far did she go?" Tommy asked.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," said Edward, quite truly,
"how far she went. I shall know better to-morrow."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SOUTH DOWNS</div>


<div class='cap'>THE day was long. Though the aeroplane flew
to admiration, though Tommy adored him
and all his works, though the skylarks sang, and
the downs were drenched in sunshine, Edward
Basingstoke admitted to himself, before half its
length was known to him, that the day was long.</div>

<p>He climbed the cliff above Cuckmere and sat
in the sunshine there, where the gulls flashed
white wings and screamed like babies; he watched
the tide, milk-white with the fallen chalk of England's
edge, come sousing in over the brown,
seaweed-covered rocks; he felt the crisp warmth
of the dry turf under his hand, and smelt the
sweet smell of the thyme and the furze and the
sea, and it was all good. But it was long. And,
for the first time in his life, being alone was lonely.</p>

<p>And for the second time since the day when
Charles, bounding at him from among the clean
straw of an Oxford stable, had bounded into his
affections, he had left that strenuous dog behind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>He got out his road map and spread it in the
sun&mdash;with stones at the corners to cheat the wind
that, on those Downs, never sleeps&mdash;and tried to
believe that he was planning his itinerary, and
even to pretend to himself that he should start to-morrow
and walk to Lewes. But instead his eyes
followed the map's indication of the road to that
meadow where the red wall was, and presently he
found that he was no longer looking at the map,
but at the book of memory, and most at the pictures
painted there only that morning. Already
it seemed a very long time ago.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Mr. Basingstoke, alone at
the cliff's edge, "that this time it really is <em>it</em>. It's
different from what I thought. It's confoundedly
unsettling."</p>

<p>Like all healthy young men, he had always desired
and intended to fall in love; he had even
courted the experience, and honestly tried to lose
his heart, but with a singular lack of success. In
the girls he had met he had found gaiety, good
looks, and a certain vague and general attractiveness&mdash;the
common attribute of youth and girlhood&mdash;but
nothing that even began to transfigure
the world as his poets taught him that love should
transfigure it. The little, trivial emotions which
he had found in pressing hands and gazing into
eyes had never lured him further than the gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and the hand-clasp. Yet he had thought himself
to be in love more than once.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps this isn't the real thing, either,"
he tried to reassure himself. "How could it be?"</p>

<p>Then he explained to himself, as he had often
explained to Vernon, that love at first sight was
impossible. Love, he had held and proclaimed,
was not the result of the mere attraction exercised
by beauty&mdash;it was the response of mind to mind,
the admiration of character and qualities&mdash;the satisfaction
of one's nature by the mental and moral
attributes of the beloved. That was not exactly
how he had put it, but that was what he had
meant. And now&mdash;he had seen a girl once, for
ten minutes, and already he could think of nothing
else. Even if he thought of something else he
could perceive the thought of her behind those
other thoughts, waiting, alluring, and sure of
itself, to fill his mind the moment he let it in.</p>

<p>"Idiot," he said at last, got up from the turf,
and pocketed the map, "to-morrow she'll be quite
ordinary and just like any other girl. You go for
a long walk, young-fellow-my-lad, and think out
a water-mill for Tommy."</p>

<p>This had, indeed, been more than half promised.
Mr. Basingstoke was one of those persons whom
their friends call thorough; their enemies say that
they carry everything too far. If he did a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
at all, he liked to do it thoroughly. If he wrote a
duty-letter to an aunt, he wrote a long one, and
made it amusing. As often as not he would illustrate
it with little pictures. If he gave a shilling
to a beggar he would immediately add tobacco
and agreeable conversation. One of his first acts,
on coming into his inheritance, had been to pension
his old nurse, who was poor and a widow with
far too many children&mdash;too many, because she was
a widow and poor and had to go out to work instead
of looking after her family, as she wanted
to do. Any one else would have written and told
her she was to have two pounds a week as long as
she lived. Edward sent her a large box of hot-house
flowers&mdash;her birthday happening to occur at
about that date&mdash;the most expensive and beautiful
flowers he could find, anonymously. Then he sent
her a fat hamper bursting with excellent things to
eat and drink&mdash;and a box of toys and clothes for
the children. The lady who "served" him with
the clothes was amused at his choice&mdash;but approved
it. And in the end he told his solicitors&mdash;smiling
to himself at the novel possession&mdash;to
write and tell the woman that an old employer
had secured her an annuity. Later he went down
to see her, to find her incredibly happy and prosperous,
and to hear the wonderful and mysterious
tale. So now, in the case of Tommy, most people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
would have thought an aeroplane and a motor-ride
as much as any little boy could expect. But
Mr. Basingstoke liked to give people much more
than they could expect. It was not enough to give
them enough. He liked to give a feast.</p>

<p>That evening after tea, Tommy breathing hard
on the back of his neck, he sketched the water-wheel
with the highest degree of precision and a
superfluous wealth of detail. But the thought
was with him through it all.</p>

<p>Next morning he went to the trysting-place,
through the fresh, sweet morning. He climbed
the wall, sat down on the log, and waited. He
waited an hour, and she did not come. It says a
good deal for his tenacity of purpose that when
he went home he began at once on the water-wheel.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he took Charles out for a walk.
Charles chased and killed a hen, and was butted
by a goat, before they reached the end of the
street; knocked a leg of mutton off the block at
the butcher's in the next village; bit the rural
police to the very undershirt, and also to the tune
of ten compensating shillings; and was run over
by a bicycle, which twisted its pedal in the consequent
fall, and grazed its rider's hands and
trousers knees. After each adventure Charles was
firmly punished, but, though chastised, he was not
chastened, and when they met a dog-cart coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
slowly down a hill he was quite ready to run in
front of it, barking and leaping at the horse's nose.
The horse, which appeared to Charles's master to
be a thoroughbred, shied. There was a whirl of
dust and hoofs and brown flank, a cry from the
driver&mdash;another cry, a fierce bark from Charles,
ending in a howl of agony&mdash;the next instant the
horse had bolted and Edward was left in the dusty
road, Charles writhing in the dust, and the dog-cart
almost out of sight.</p>

<p>"Charles, old man&mdash;Charles, lie still, can't you?
Let me see if you're hurt."</p>

<p>He stooped, and as he stooped Charles did lie
still.</p>

<p>His master lifted the heavy, muscular body
that had been so full of life and energy. It lay
limp and lifeless, head and hind-quarters drooping
over his arm like a wet shawl.</p>

<p>Basingstoke sat down on the roadside with the
dog across his knees. For him the light of life was
out. Men do not cry, of course, as women do when
their dogs die, but he could not see very clearly.
Presently he found himself face to face with that
question, always so disconcerting, even to criminals&mdash;what
to do with the body. He was miles
from his inn, and Charles was no light weight. He
could not leave the dog in the road. His friend
must have decent burial. There was nothing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it but to wait till some cart should come by and
then to ask for a lift.</p>

<p>So he sat there, thinking such thoughts as men
do think in adversity. After a calamity, when
the first excitement of horror dies down, one always
says, "How different everything was yesterday!"
and Mr. Basingstoke said what we all
say. Yesterday Charles was alive and well, and
his master had not taken him out because he
wanted to be at leisure to think&mdash;he realized that
now&mdash;about the girl whom he was to have met to-day.
And he had not met the girl. And Charles
was dead.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't left you at home yesterday,
old boy," said Mr. Basingstoke.</p>

<p>And then came the sound of hoofs, and he prepared
to stop the vehicle, whatever it was, and
beg for a lift for himself and what he carried. But
when the wheels came near and he saw that it
was the very cart that had run over Charles he
sat down again and kept his eyes on the ground.
It wasn't their fault, of course, but still.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The cart stopped and some one was saying: "I
hope the dog isn't much hurt." A hard, cold
voice it was.</p>

<p>Edward got out his hand from under Charles
to take his hat off, and said: "My dog is
dead."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry, but it was the dog's
fault," said the voice, aggressively.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edward.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done," said the voice.
"It was nearly a nasty accident for us."</p>

<p>"I apologize for my dog's conduct," said Edward,
formally.</p>

<p>And then came another voice, "But, Aunt Loo,
can't we <em>do</em> anything?"</p>

<p>Of course you will have known all along whose
voice that would be. Edward was less discerning.
He had been far too much occupied with Charles
and the horse to do more than realize that the two
people in the cart were women&mdash;and now when he
heard again the voice that had talked to him yesterday
in the freshness of the morning, the shock
sent his blood surging. He looked up&mdash;face, neck,
ears were burning. Men do not blush, but if they
did you would have said that Mr. Basingstoke
blushed in that hour.</p>

<p>He looked up. Holding the reins was a hard,
angular woman of fifty, the sort that plays golf
and billiards and is perfectly competent with
horses. Beside her sat the girl, and under her
white hat the crimson of her face matched his
own. The distress he felt at this unpropitious
coincidence deepened his color. Hers deepened,
too.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't do anything, thank you," he said,
just a moment too late. For his pause had given
the aunt time to look from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, shortly.</p>

<p>The girl spoke, also just too late.</p>

<p>"At least, let us take the poor, dear dog home
for you," she said.</p>

<p>"By all means," said the aunt, with an air of
finality. "Where shall we leave it?"</p>

<p>"I am at the Five Bells, in Jevington," said
Edward, and was thankful to feel his ears a shade
less fiery.</p>

<p>"I see," said the aunt, with hideous significance.
"Put it in at the back, will you?"</p>

<p>She spoke as though Charles were a purchase
she had just made and Mr. Basingstoke the shopman.</p>

<p>He would have liked to refuse, but how dear of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Her'">her</ins> to suggest it. "Thank you," he said, and
came through the dust to the back of the cart.</p>

<p>Almost before he had replaced the second pin
the cart moved, and he was left alone in the white
road.</p>

<p>The way home was long and dismal&mdash;its only
incident the finding of a little white handkerchief
in the dust about a mile from the scene of the
tragedy. It was softly scented. Of course it
might be Aunt Loo's handkerchief, but he preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to think that it was Hers. He shook the
dust from it and put it in his pocket. As he came
down the village street he remembered how, only
yesterday, he had heard, just here by the saddler's,
that strangled, choking bark which betokened
Charles's recognition of his master's approach.
Well, there would be no such barking welcome
for him now.</p>

<p>Some other dog was choking and barking,
though, and in that very stable where Charles had
choked and barked. And Charles's body would
have been put in the stable, no doubt. He would
go round and see. He went round, opened the
stable door, and next moment was struck full in
the chest by what seemed to be a heavy missive
hurled with tremendous force. It was Charles,
who had leaped from the end of his chain to greet
his master&mdash;Charles, alive and almost idiotic in
his transports of uncouth affection. Edward felt
the dog all over&mdash;to see if any bones were broken.
Charles never winced. There was not a cut or a
bruise on him! The two sat on the straw embracing
for quite a long time.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, seems quite himself, don't he?" said
Robert. "Miss Davenant she brought him. Told
me to tell you the dog come to himself quite
sudden on the cart. Must have fainted, young
miss said, and when he come to it was all she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
could do to hold him down. He seems to have
come to quite sudden and all wild-like among
their legs in the bottom of the cart till miss
dragged him out&mdash;nearly upset the old lady right
out of the cart, coming up sudden under her
knees. Awful nasty she was about it. Said the
dog must have been shamming. Thank you, sir.
I'll drink your health and the dog's."</p>

<p>"Shamming, indeed!" said Edward to himself,
and resented the cruel and silly aspersion. Yet,
stay, was it really quite impossible that Charles,
fearing that the same punishment might visit this
last exploit as had followed his earlier outrages,
had really shammed, to disarm a doting master?
Edward put away the thought. It was impossible.</p>

<p>The main thing was that Charles was alive.
But, after all, <em>was</em> that the main thing? Now that
the dog was alive it suddenly ceased to be. The
main thing was that he had not seen her that
morning and that he must, somehow, see her
again.</p>

<p>Somehow. But how? This gave him food for
thought.</p>

<p>He went into his parlor and sat down&mdash;to think.
But, try as he could, there seemed no way. Of
course he could go next morning&mdash;of course he
would go next morning&mdash;and every morning for a
week. But if she hadn't come to-day, why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she come to-morrow or the next day, or the day
after that?</p>

<p>Or the handkerchief. Wouldn't it be natural
that he should call to return it and to thank them
for taking care of the lifeless Charles, and apologize
for that thoughtless animal's inconvenient and
sudden change of attitude? Yes, that would have
been natural if the girl had not blushed and if he
had not turned scarlet.</p>

<p>He took out the handkerchief and spread it on
the table&mdash;what silly little things girls' handkerchiefs
were! Then he looked at it more closely.
Then he took it to the window, stretched it tightly,
and looked more closely than ever. Yes, there was
something on it, something intended&mdash;not just
the marks of the road. There were letters&mdash;pencil
letters an inch or more long, very rough and straggling,
but quite unmistakable&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce soir 12 heures.</i>
At least, it might be 13, but, then, she wasn't an
Italian.</p>

<p>The light of life blazed up, and the world suddenly
became beautiful again. She had not forgotten&mdash;she
had wished to come to meet him&mdash;something
had prevented her coming in the morning.
But to-night she would come. Twelve o'clock!
A strange hour to choose. Bah! who was he to
cavil at the hour she chose to set? How sweet
and soft the handkerchief was!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LA MANCHE</div>


<div class='cap'>THE bolts of the back door did not creak at all
when, at twenty minutes to twelve, Edward
Basingstoke let himself out. Tommy always saw
to the bolts, for his own purposes, with a feather
and a little salad oil.</div>

<p>The night was sweet and dark under the trees
and in among the houses. In the village no lamp
gleamed at any window. Beyond the village, the
starshine and dew lent a gray shimmer to field and
hedge, and the road lay before him like a pale
ribbon. He crossed the meadow, climbed the
wall, and dropped. The earth sounded dully
under his feet, and twigs crackled as he moved.
There was no other sound. She was not there.
He dared not light a match to see his watch's face
by. Perhaps he was early. Well, he could wait.
He waited. He waited and waited and waited.
He listened till his ears were full of the soft rustlings
and movements which go to make up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
silence of country night. He strained his eyes to
see some movement in the gray park dotted with
black trees. But all was still. It was very dark
under the trees. And through all his listening he
thought, thought. Did it do to trust to impulses&mdash;to
instincts? Did it do, rather, to disregard
them? A gipsy woman had said to him once,
"Your first thoughts are straight&mdash;give yourself
time to think twice and you'll think wrong."
What he had felt that morning while he waited,
vainly, for her to come had taught him that, fool
as he might be for his pains, the feeling that possessed
him was more like the love poets talked of
than he would have believed any feeling of his
could be. And, after all, love at first sight <em>was</em>
possible&mdash;was it not the theme of half the romances
in the world? He felt that at this, their second
meeting, he must know whether he meant to
advance or to retreat. Always when he had
trusted his impulse his choice had been a wise one.
But was a choice necessary now? His instincts
told him that it was. This midnight meeting&mdash;planned
by her and not by him&mdash;it was a meeting
for "good-by." No girl would make an assignation
at that hour just to tell a man that she intended
to meet him again the next day. So he
must know whether he meant to permit himself to
be said good-by to. And he knew that he did not.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The day had been long, but it seemed to him
that already the night had been longer than the
day. Could he have mistaken the hour? No, it
was certainly twelve&mdash;or thirteen. Then his heart
leaped up. If it <em>had</em> been thirteen, that meant one
o'clock. Perhaps it was not one yet. But he
felt that he knew it to be at least three. Yet if
it were three there would be the diffused faint
illumination of dawn growing, growing. And
there was no light at all but the changeless light
of the stars. Again and again he thought he saw
her, thought he heard her. And again and again
only silence and solitude came to meet his
thoughts.</p>

<p>When at last she did come he saw her very far
off, and heard the rustle of her dress even before
he saw her.</p>

<p>He would not go to meet her across the starlit
space; that would be very dangerous. He stood
where he was till she came into the shadow. Then
he went toward her and said:</p>

<p>"At last!"</p>

<p>She drew a long breath. "Oh, I was so afraid
you wouldn't come!"</p>

<p>"I was here at twelve," he said.</p>

<p>"So you got the handkerchief. I put thirteen
because I thought if I put one&mdash;it was so difficult
to write&mdash;and, of course, I couldn't look at it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
see if it was readable. I wrote it under the driving-rug.
Oh, suppose you hadn't got it!"</p>

<p>"I can't suppose it. What should I have done
if I hadn't?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "don't! Please don't. I thought
you'd understand it was serious. I shouldn't have
asked you to come in the middle of the night to
talk nonsense as if we were at a dance."</p>

<p>"What's serious?" he said.</p>

<p>She said, "Everything," and her voice trembled.</p>

<p>He took her arm, and felt that she herself was
trembling.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down," he said, comfortably, as
one might speak to a child in trouble. "Come and
sit down and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>They sat down on the log, and he pulled the
dark cloak she wore more closely round her.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "what's happened? Why
didn't you come this morning?"</p>

<p>"I stayed too long the first time," she answered,
"and met Aunt Loo as I went in. She asked me
where I'd been. I said I'd been out to swim in
the lake. That was quite true. That <em>was</em> why I
had gone out. I've often done it. But, of course,
my hair wasn't wet. She didn't say anything.
But this morning when I came down she was
sitting in the hall, waiting for me. She asked me
if I was going bathing again, and I said, No, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
going to walk in the park. So she said, 'Charming
idea. I'll come, too.'"</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'Do,' of course. But it was awful. I
was so afraid of her seeing you."</p>

<p>"Suppose she <em>had</em> chosen to walk that way."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I thought of that. So <em>I</em> led
the way and walked straight toward you. Then
she thought whoever I was going to meet must
be the other way. So she insisted on going the
other way. I knew she would."</p>

<p>"That was subtle of you."</p>

<p>"No; it's only that she's stupid. It wouldn't
have taken any one else in."</p>

<p>"So she was baffled."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she has instincts, though she's so
stupid. She knew there was something up. And
then when we met you&mdash;oh, I <em>am</em> so glad the dog's
all right&mdash;when we met you I knew she thought
you'd something to do with my being out so early
in the morning, and then you blushed."</p>

<p>"If I did," he said, "I wasn't the only one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she said, "but I don't suppose I
should have if you hadn't. Though unjust suspicions
like that are enough to make anybody
blush. Yes, they were unjust because you had
nothing to do with my going out the first time&mdash;why,
I didn't even know there <em>was</em> a you. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
now all the fat's in the fire, and she's taking me to
Ireland or Scotland to-morrow&mdash;she won't say
which. And I couldn't bear to go and have you
think I'd made an appointment and not kept it.
It's so unbusiness-like to break appointments,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Does she suppose, then, that we&mdash;that I am&mdash;that
you have&mdash;that I should&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what she supposes. At least I
do. But it's too silly. Now I've explained everything.
Good-by. I'm glad you found the handkerchief&mdash;and
I'm <em>awfully</em> glad about Charles."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you knew his name."</p>

<p>"The stableman said it when the dog ran between
his knees and nearly knocked him down.
It's a darling dog&mdash;but isn't it strong! Good-by!"
She held out her hand. "Good-by," she said,
again.</p>

<p>"No," said he, and held the hand.</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>"Say good-by," she said. "Indeed I must go."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, releasing the hand.</p>

<p>"I've said everything there was to say&mdash;I mean,
what I came to say."</p>

<p>"There's a very great deal that you haven't
told me. I don't understand. Who does your
aunt think I am?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not tell you; you'd only laugh."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"But please tell me. I shouldn't."</p>

<p>A troubled silence answered him.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "I know there's a lot
you haven't told me. Do tell me, and let me help
you, if I can. You're worried and unhappy. I
can hear it in your voice. Tell me. Things
look different when you've put them into words.
First of all, tell me who your aunt thought I
was."</p>

<p>She sat down again with the air of definite decision.
"Very well," she said, "if you will have
it, she thought you were the piano-tuner. Why
don't you laugh?"</p>

<p>"I'm not amused yet," he said. "What piano-tuner?
And why should he&mdash;why should you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The piano-tuner is a fence," she said, "and
she thinks you're it."</p>

<p>"I don't understand a word you're saying."</p>

<p>"I don't care," she said, desperately. "I'll tell
you the whole silly story and you can laugh, if
you like. I shan't be offended. Last autumn
father brought a man to lunch, quite a nice man&mdash;sensible,
middle-aged, very well off&mdash;and next day
he told me the man had proposed for me, and I'd
better take him. He'd accepted for me."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Edward, "I thought it
was only in the <cite>Family Herald</cite> that such fathers
existed."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Laugh as much as you like," said she; "it's
true, for all that. You see, I'd refused several before
that. It's rather important for me to marry
well&mdash;my father's not rich, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't going to. And when it came to
this luncheon man I told you about there was a
scene, and my father said was there any one else,
and I said no; but he went on so frightfully and
wouldn't believe me. So at last I told him."</p>

<p>"Told him what?"</p>

<p>"That there was some one."</p>

<p>"Yes?" His voice was only more gentle for
the sudden sharp stab of disappointment which
told him what hope it was that he had nursed.</p>

<p>"And then, of course, I wouldn't say who it was.
And he sent for my aunts. Aunt Enid's worse
than Aunt Loo. And they bothered and bothered.
And at last I said it was the piano-tuner.
I don't know how I could have. Father turned
him off, of course, poor wretch, and they brought
me down here to come to my senses. Aunt Loo
never saw the miserable piano-tuner, and she
thinks you're him. So now you know. And that's
why they're taking me away from here. They
think the piano-tuner is pursuing me. I believe
Aunt Loo thinks you trained the dog to bark at
horses so as to get a chance to speak to me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you care much for your father?" he asked,
"or for any of them?"</p>

<p>"It's a horrid thing to say," she answered, "but
I don't. The only one I care for's Aunt Alice&mdash;she's
an invalid and a darling. Father thinks
about nothing but bridge and races, and Aunt
Loo's all golf and horses, and Aunt Enid's a social
reformer. I hate them all. And I've never been
anywhere or seen anything. I'm not allowed to
write to any one. And they don't have any one
here at all, and I'm not to see a single soul till I've
come to my senses, as they call it. And that's
why I was so glad to talk to you yesterday."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, very kindly. "Now what can
I do for you? Where's the other man? Can't I
post a letter to him or something? Why doesn't
he come and rescue you?"</p>

<p>"What other man?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The man you're fond of. The man whose
name you wouldn't tell them."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, lightly, and just as though it
didn't matter. "There isn't any other man."</p>

<p>"There isn't?" he echoed, joyously.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. I just made him up&mdash;and
then I called him the piano-tuner."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "forgive me for asking, but
I must be quite sure&mdash;you don't care for any man
at all?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I don't," she answered, resentfully,
"I shouldn't go about caring about any one who
didn't care for me&mdash;and if any one cared for me
and I cared for him, of course we should run away
with each other at once."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Basingstoke, slowly and distinctly.
"Then if there isn't any one else I
suggest that you run away with me."</p>

<p>It was fully half a minute before she spoke.
Then she said: "I don't blame you. I deserve it
for asking you to meet me and coming out like
this. But I thought you were different."</p>

<p>"Deserve what?"</p>

<p>"To be insulted and humiliated. To be made
a jest of."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that my offer is no more insulting
or humiliating than any of your other offers.
I like you very much. I think you like me. And
I believe we should suit each other very well.
Don't be angry. I'm perfectly serious. Don't
speak for a minute. Listen. I've just come into
some money, and I'm going about the country,
seeing places and people. I'm just a tramp, as I
told you. Come and be a tramp, too. We'll go
anywhere you like. We'll take the map and you
shall put your finger on any place you think you'd
like to see, and we'll go straight off to it, by rail or
motor, or in a cart, or a caravan, if you'd like it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Caravans must be charming. To go wherever
you like, stop when you like&mdash;go on when you
like. Come with me. I don't believe you'd ever
regret it. And I know I never should."</p>

<p>"I believe you're serious," she said, half incredulously.</p>

<p>"Of course I am. It's a way out of all your
troubles."</p>

<p>"I couldn't," she said, earnestly, "marry any
one I wasn't very fond of. And one can't be fond
of a person one's only seen twice."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" he said, a little sadly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I think it's very fine of
you to offer me this&mdash;just to get me out of a
bother. And I'm sorry I thought you were being
horrid. I'll tell you something. I've always
thought that even if I cared very much for some
one I should be almost afraid to marry him unless
I knew him very, very well. Girls do make such
frightful mistakes. You ought to see a man every
day for a year, and then, perhaps, you'd know if
you could really bear to live with him all your life."</p>

<p>Instead of answering her directly, he said:
"You would love the life in the caravan. Think
of the camp&mdash;making a fire of sticks and cooking
your supper under the stars, and the great moonlit
nights, and sleeping in pine woods and waking
in the dawn and curling yourself up in your blanket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and going to sleep again till I shouted out that the
fire was alight and breakfast nearly ready."</p>

<p>"I wish I could come with you without having
to be married."</p>

<p>"Come, then," he said. "Come on any terms.
I'll take you as a sister if I'm not to take you as
a wife."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it? Really?" she said. "Oh,
why shouldn't I? I believe you would take me&mdash;and
I should be perfectly free then. I've got a
little money of my own that my godmother left
me. I was twenty-one the other day. I don't get
it, of course. My father says it costs that to keep
me. But if I were to run away he would have to
give it to me, wouldn't he? And then I could pay
you back what you spent on me. Oh, I wish I
could. Will you really take me?"</p>

<p>But he had had time to think. "No," he said,
"on reflection, I don't think I will."</p>

<p>But she did not hear him, for as he spoke she
spoke, too. "Hush!" she said. "Look &mdash; look
there."</p>

<p>Across the park, near the house, lights were
moving.</p>

<p>"They're looking for me," she gasped. "They've
found out that I'm away. Oh, what shall I do?
Aunt Loo will never be decent to me again. What
<em>shall</em> I do?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come with me," he said, strongly. "I'll take
care of you. Come."</p>

<p>He took her hand. "I swear by God," he said,
"that everything shall be as you choose. Only
come now&mdash;come away from these people. You're
twenty-one. You're your own mistress. Let me
help you to get free from all this stuffy, stupid
tyranny."</p>

<p>"You won't make me marry you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can't make you do anything," he said.
"But if you're coming, it must be now."</p>

<p>"Come, then," she said, making for the ladder.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CROW'S NEST</div>


<div class='cap'>HE had brought a ball of string in his pocket,
this time, and he was glad to know he could
lower the ladder by it&mdash;for the thud of a falling
ladder would sound far in the night stillness.
From the top of the wall he held the ladder while
she mounted.</div>

<p>"Sit here a moment," he said, "while I get rid
of the ladder." He lowered it gently, drew the
string up, leaped to the ground outside the wall,
and held up his hands to her.</p>

<p>"Jump," he whispered. "I'll catch you."</p>

<p>But even as he spoke she had turned and was
hanging by her hands. He let her do it her own
way. She dropped expertly, landing with a little
rebound. He was glad he had not tried to catch
her. It would have been a poor beginning to their
comradeship if he had, at the very outset, shown
doubts of her competence to do anything she set
out to do.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>They stood under the wall very near together.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she said.</p>

<p>"I must get a car and take you away. Are you
afraid to be left alone for a couple of hours?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think so," she said. "But where?
Did you notice the lights as you got over the
wall?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they were still near the house."</p>

<p>The two were walking side by side along the
road now.</p>

<p>"If you were any ordinary girl I should be
afraid to leave you to think things over&mdash;for fear
you should think you'd been rash or silly or something&mdash;and
worry yourself about all sorts of nonsense,
and perhaps end in bolting back to your
hutch before I could come back to you. But since
it's you&mdash;let's cut across the downs here&mdash;we'll
keep close to the edge of the wood."</p>

<p>Their feet now trod the soft grass.</p>

<p>"How sensible of you to wear a dark cloak," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "a really romantic young lady
in distress would have come in white muslin and
blue ribbons, wouldn't she?"</p>

<p>He glowed to the courage that let her jest at
such a moment.</p>

<p>"Where am I to wait?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There's an old farm-house not far away," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
said. "If you don't mind waiting there. Could
you?"</p>

<p>"Who lives there?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. I happen to have the key. I was
looking at it yesterday. It's not furnished, but
I noticed some straw and packing-cases. I could
rig you up some sort of lounge, but don't do it
if you're afraid. If you're afraid to be left to
yourself we'll walk together to Eastbourne. But
if we do we're much more likely to be caught."</p>

<p>"I'm not in the least afraid. Why should I be?"
she said, and they toiled up the hill among the
furze bushes in the still starlight.</p>

<p>"What they'll do," she said, presently, "when
they're sure I'm not in the park, is to go down to
your inn and see if you're there."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'm counting on that. That's
why I said two or three hours. You see, I must be
there when they do come, and the minute they're
gone I'll go for the motor. Look here&mdash;I've got
some chocolate that I got for a kiddy to-day;
luckily, I forgot to give it to him; and here are
some matches, only don't strike them if you can
help it. Now, stick to it."</p>

<p>They went on in silence; half-way up the hill
he took her arm to help her. Then, over the
crest of the hill, in a hollow of the downs there
was the dark-spread blot of house and farm buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
They went down the road. Nothing
stirred&mdash;only as they neared the farm-yard a
horse in the stable rattled his halter against the
manger and they heard his hoofs moving on
the cobbled floor of his stall. They stood listening.
No, all was still.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," he said, and led her
round to the side of the house. The key grated
a little as he turned it in the lock. He threw back
the door.</p>

<p>"This is the kitchen," he said. "Stand just
inside and I'll make a nest for you. I know exactly
where to lay my hands on the straw."</p>

<p>There was rustling in the darkness and a sound
of boards grating on bricks. She stood at the
door and waited.</p>

<p>"Ready," he said.</p>

<p>"They'll find me," she said. "We shall never
get away."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that," said he.</p>

<p>"I must have been mad to come," he heard
through the darkness.</p>

<p>"We're all mad once in our lives," he said,
cheerfully. "Now roll yourself in your cloak.
Give me your hands&mdash;so." He led her to the
straw nest he had made, and lowered her to it.</p>

<p>"Do you wish you hadn't come?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope to Heaven I haven't misjudged you,"
he said, with the first trace of anxiety she had yet
heard in his voice. "If you should be the kind of
girl who's afraid of the dark&mdash;"</p>

<p>The straw rustled as she curled herself more
comfortably in her nest.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," she said.</p>

<p>"Look here," said he, "here's my match-box,
but don't strike a light among the straw. The
door into the house is locked and the key's on
this side of the door. Can you come to the back
door and lock it after me, and then find your way
back to your nest?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and felt her way past the big
copper to the door.</p>

<p>"Sure you're not frightened?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said she.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go," said he, and went.</p>

<p>She locked the door and crept back to the straw.
He waited till its crackling told him that she had
found her way back to her couch. Then he
started for Jevington.</p>

<p>And as he went he told himself that she was
right. She had been mad to come, and he had
been mad to let her come. But there was no
going back now.</p>

<p>There was no looking back, even. From the
brow of the hill the road was down-hill all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
way, and he ran, his rubber shoes patting almost
noiselessly in the dust. At his inn the bolt
yielded to his knife-point's pressure, the well-oiled
lock let him in without a murmur, the
stairs hardly creaked more than stairs can creak
in their dark solitudes when we lie awake and
listen to them and wonder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The night was
as silent as a thought, and when at last the silence
was shattered by the clatter of hoofs and the
jangle of harness, Mr. Basingstoke's head turned
a little on his pillow, not restlessly.</p>

<p>He heard the clanging bell echo in the flagged
passage; heard through the plaster walls the
heavy awakening of his host, the scrape of a
match, the hasty, blundering toilet; heard the
big bar dropped from the front door; voices&mdash;the
groom's voice, the host's voice, the aunt's
voice.</p>

<p>Then heavy steps on the stairs and a knock at
his door.</p>

<p>"Very sorry to disturb you, sir," came the
muffled tones through the door, almost cringingly
apologetic, "but could you get up, sir, just for a
minute? Miss Davenant from the Hall wants a
word with you&mdash;about your dawg, sir, as I understand.
If you could oblige, sir&mdash;very inconvenient,
I know, sir, but the Hall is very highly
thought of in the village, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;?" said Mr. Basingstoke, very
loudly, and got out of bed. "I'll dress and come
down," he said.</p>

<p>He did dress, to the accompaniment of voices
below&mdash;replaced, that is, the collar, tie, and boots
he had taken off&mdash;and then he began to pack, his
mind busy with the phrases in which he would explain
that a house in which these nocturnal disturbances
occurred was not fit for the sojourning
of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, hang it all, that would not be fair to
the landlord&mdash;he must find some other tale.</p>

<p>When he had kept the lady waiting as long as
he thought a man might have kept her who had
really a toilet to make, he went slowly down.
Voices sounded in the parlor, and a slab of light
from its door lay across the sanded passage.</p>

<p>He went in; the landlord went out, closing the
door almost too discreetly.</p>

<p>Mr. Basingstoke and the aunt looked at each
other. She was very upright and wore brown
gloves and a brown, boat-shaped hat with an
aggressive quill.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> here, then?" she said.</p>

<p>"Where else, madam?" said Mr. Basingstoke.</p>

<p>"I should like you," said the aunt, deliberately,
"to be somewhere else within the next hour. I
will make it worth your while."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Edward murmured.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I ought to tell you," said she, "that
I saw through that business of the dog. He was
well trained, I admit. But I can't have my niece
annoyed in this way."</p>

<p>"The lady must certainly not be annoyed,"
said Edward, with feeling.</p>

<p>"I came to-night to see if you were here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"It is an unusual hour for a call," said Edward,
"but I am proportionally honored."</p>

<p>"&mdash;to see if you were here, and, if you were,
to tell you that my niece is not."</p>

<p>Edward cast a puzzled eye around the crowded
parlor. "No," he said. "No."</p>

<p>"I mean," Miss Davenant went on, "that my
niece has left this neighborhood and will not return
while you are here; so you are wasting your
time and trouble."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> see," said Edward, helpfully.</p>

<p>"You will gain nothing by this attitude," said
Miss Davenant. "If you will consent to leave
Jevington to-night I will give you twenty pounds."</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds!" he repeated, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, twenty pounds, on condition that you
promise not to molest this defenseless girl."</p>

<p>"Put up your money, madam," said Edward
Basingstoke, with a noble gesture copied from the
best theatrical models, "and dry your eyes.
Never shall it be said that Edward Basingstoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was deaf to the voice of a lady in distress. Lay
your commands on me, and be assured that, for
me, to hear is to obey."</p>

<p>"You are very impertinent, young man," Miss
Davenant told him, "and you won't do yourself
any good by talking like a book. Clear out of
this to-night, and I'll give you twenty pounds.
Stay, and take the consequences."</p>

<p>"Meaning&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, stay if you like. You won't see her.
She won't return to Jevington till you're gone.
So I tell you you'd better accept my offer and
go."</p>

<p>"Accept your offer and go," repeated Edward.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds," said the lady, persuasively.</p>

<p>"Tempt me not!" said Edward. "To a man in
my position.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Edward, "there are chords even in
a piano-tuner's breast&mdash;chords which, too roughly
touched, will turn and rend the smiter."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" said Miss Davenant, "I believe
the man's insane."</p>

<p>"Withdraw that harsh expression," he pleaded.
And then, without warning, the situation ceased
to amuse him. Here he was, swimming in the
deep, smooth waters of diplomacy, and suddenly
diplomacy seemed a sticky medium. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
have liked Miss Davenant to be a man&mdash;a man in
green-silk Georgian coat and buckled shoes; himself
also gloriously Georgian, in murray-colored
cut velvet, with Mechlin at wrists and throat.
Then they could have betaken themselves to the
bowling-green and fought it out with ringing
rapiers, by the light of the lantern held in the
landlord's trembling fingers. Or at dawn, in the
meadow the red wall bounded, there could have
been measured pacings&mdash;a dropped handkerchief,
two white puffs drifting away on the chill, sweet
air, and Edward Basingstoke could have handed
his smoking pistol to his second and mounted his
horse&mdash;Black Belial&mdash;and so away to his lady,
leaving his adversary wounded slightly ("winged,"
of course, was the word). Thus honor would have
been satisfied, and Edward well in the lime-light.
But in this little box of an overfurnished room,
by the light of an ill-trimmed paraffin-lamp, to
rag an anxious aunt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He withdrew himself
slowly from diplomacy&mdash;tried to find an inch or
two of dry truth to stand on.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you say something?" asked
the anxious aunt.</p>

<p>"I will," said Mr. Basingstoke. "Madam, I
have to ask your pardon for an unpardonable liberty.
I have deceived you. I am not what you
think. I am not a piano-tuner, but an engineer."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you said you were.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I said there were chords in the
breasts of piano-tuners."</p>

<p>"But if you aren't, how did you know there
was one?"</p>

<p>This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riposte</i> he had not anticipated. Frankness
had its drawbacks&mdash;so small a measure of it as he
had allowed himself. He leaped headlong into
diplomacy again.</p>

<p>"Look back on what you have said, not only
to me, but to others," he said, solemnly, and saw
that the chance shot had gone home. "Now," he
said, "don't let us prolong an interview which
cannot but be painful to us both. I am not the
piano-tuner for whom you take me. You are a
complete stranger to me. The only link that
binds us is the fact that your horse ran over my
dog and that you bore the apparently lifeless body
home for me. Yet if you wish me to leave the
neighborhood, I will leave it. In fact, I was going
in any case," he added, struggling against diplomacy.</p>

<p>Miss Davenant looked at him. "You're speaking
the truth," she said; "you're not the piano-tuner.
But you got as red as fire yesterday. So
did my niece. What was that for?"</p>

<p>"I cannot explain my complicated color-scheme,"
said Edward, "without diagrams and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
magic-lantern. And as for your niece, I can lay
my hand on my heart and say that the light of
declining day never illumined that face for me
till the moment when it also illumined yours."</p>

<p>"Are you deceiving me?" Miss Davenant asked,
weakly, and Edward answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am; but not in the way you think.
We all have our secrets, but mine are not the
secrets of the piano-tuner."</p>

<p>Some one sneezed in the passage outside.</p>

<p>"Our host has been eavesdropping," said Edward,
softly.</p>

<p>"Well, if he doesn't make more of this conversation
than I do, he won't make much," said Miss
Davenant. "I don't trust you."</p>

<p>"That would make it all the easier for me to
deceive you," said Edward, "if I sought to deceive."</p>

<p>"You've got too much language for me," said
Miss Davenant. "If you're not the man, I apologize."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said Edward.</p>

<p>"If you are, I don't wonder so much at what
happened in London. Good night. Sorry to have
disturbed you."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," said Edward, "that you
might as well tell me why you <em>did</em> disturb me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were the piano-tuner," she said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"you knew that perfectly well. And I don't want
piano-tuners hanging round Jevington. I'm sorry
I offered the money. I ought to have seen."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Basingstoke, "and, since
my presence here annoys you, know that by this
time to-morrow I shall be far away."</p>

<p>"There's one thing more," said Miss Davenant.
But Mr. Basingstoke was never to know what
that one thing was, for at the instant a wild
shriek rang through the quiet night, there was a
scuffle outside, hoarse voices in anger and pain,
the door burst open, and Miss Davenant's groom
staggered in.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, ma'am"&mdash;he still remembered his
station, and it was thus he affirmed it&mdash;"beg pardon,
ma'am, but this 'ere dawg&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was too true. Charles, perhaps conscious of
his master's presence in the parlor, had slipped
his collar, scratched a hole under the stable door,
and, finding the groom and the landlord in the
passage, barring his entrance, had bitten the
groom's trousers leg. It hung, gaping, from knee
to ankle&mdash;with Charles still attached. Charles's
master choked the dog off, but confidential conversation
was at an end, even when a sovereign
had slipped from his hand to the groom's.</p>

<p>"Seems the young lady's missing," said the
host, when the dog-cart had rattled up the street.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Edward. "Well, I think I also
shall retreat. Will it inconvenience you if I leave
my traps to be sent on? I shall walk into Seaford
and catch the early train."</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault the lady come, sir," said
the landlord, sulky but deferential.</p>

<p>"I know it," said the guest, "and I am not
leaving because of her coming. I should have
left in any case. But it is a fine night, I have a
fancy for a walk, and it does not seem worth while
to go to bed again. If you will kindly take this,
pay your bill out of it, and divide the remainder
between Robert and Gladys, I shall be very much
obliged. I've been very comfortable here and I
shall certainly come again."</p>

<p>He pressed a five-pound note into the landlord's
hand, and before that bewildered one could
think of anything more urgent than the commonplaces
which begin, "I'm sure, sir," or, "I
shouldn't like to think," he and Charles had
turned their backs on the Five Bells, and the
landlord was staring after them. The round,
white back of Charles showed for quite a long
time through the darkness. Slowly he drew the
bolts, put out the lights, and went back to bed.</p>

<p>"It's a rum go," he told his wife, after he had
told her all he had heard and overheard, "a most
peculiar rum go. But he's a gentleman, he is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
whichever way you look at it. Miss up at the
Hall might do a jolly sight worse, if you ask me.
Shouldn't wonder, come to think of it, if she ain't
waiting for him around the corner, as it is."</p>

<p>"He's the kind of gentleman a girl <em>would</em> wait
around the corner for," said the landlady. "It's
his eyes, partly, I think. And he's got such a
kind look. But if she is&mdash;waiting round the corner,
I mean, like what you said&mdash;he <em>have</em> got a
face to go on like what he did to Miss Davenant."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the landlord, blowing out the
candle, "he <em>have</em> got a face, whichever way you
look at it."</p>

<p>It was bright daylight when a motor&mdash;one of
the strong, fierce kind, no wretched taxicab, but
a private motor of obvious speed and spirit&mdash;blundered
over the shoulder of the downs down
the rutty road to Crow's Nest Farm.</p>

<p>Mr. Basingstoke, happy to his finger-tips as
well as to the inmost recesses of the mind in his
consciousness of results achieved and difficulties
overcome, slipped from the throbbing motor and
went quickly around to the back door, Charles
with him, straining at the lead. The path that
led to the door had its bricks outlined with green
grass, a house-leek spread its rosettes on the
sloping lichened tiles of the roof, and in the corner
of the window the toad-flax flaunted its little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
helmets of orange and sulphur-color. He tapped
gently on the door. Nothing from within answered
him&mdash;no voice, no movement, no creak of board,
no rustle of straw, no click of little heels on the
floor of stone. She might be asleep&mdash;must be.
He knocked again, and still silence answered him.
Then a wave of possibilities and impossibilities
rose suddenly and swept against Mr. Basingstoke's
heart. So sudden was it, and so strong
was it, that for a moment he felt the tremor of a
physical nausea. He put his hand to the latch,
meaning to try with his shoulder the forcing of
the lock. But the door was not locked. The latch
clicked, yielding to his hand, and the door opened
into the kitchen, with its wide old chimneyplace,
big mantel-shelf, its oven and pump, its brewing-copper
and its washing-copper, its litter of packing-cases
and straw, and the little nest he had
made for her between the copper and the big
barrel. The soft, diffused daylight showed him
every corner, and Charles sniffing, as it seemed,
every corner at once. He crossed over and tried
the door that led to the house. But he knew,
before his hand found it unyielding, that it had
not been unlocked since last he saw it. He knew,
quite surely, that the lady was not there. There
was no sign or trace of her, save the rounded nest
where she must have snuggled for at least a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the night that he had spent in such strenuous
diplomacy, such ardent organization, for her sake.
No other trace of her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, on the flap-table
by the window his match-box, set as weight to
keep in its place a handkerchief. It was own
sister to the little one his pocket still held&mdash;and,
as he took it up, exhaled the same faint, delicate
fragrance. He read it, Charles snuffling and burrowing
in the straw at his feet. On it a few words
were written, some illegible, but these few plain:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>I will write to General Post-Office, London.</p></div>

<p>There are no words for the thoughts of the
baffled adventurer as he locked the door and
walked around the farm to the waiting motor. His
only word on the way was to Charles, and it
calmed, for an instant, even that restless spirit.</p>

<p>"London," he said to his chauffeur. "My
friend isn't coming," and he and Charles tumbled
into the car together.</p>

<p>A line of faces drawn up against a long fence
watched his departure with mild curiosity. Twenty
or thirty calves and their rustic attendant saw
him go. The chauffeur looked again at the house's
blank windows and echoed the landlord's words.</p>

<p>"Rum go!" he said to himself. "Most extraordinary
rum go."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TUNBRIDGE WELLS</div>


<div class='cap'>AN earnest and prolonged struggle with Charles
now occupied Mr. Basingstoke. Charles was
determined to stand on the seat with his paws on
the side of the car, to look out and to be in readiness
to leap out should any passing object offer
a more than trivial appeal. His master was determined
that Charles should lie on the mat in
the bottom of the car, and, what is more, that he
should lie there quietly. The discussion became
animated and ended in blows. It was just at the
crisis of the affair, when Edward had lightly
smitten the hard, bullet head and Charles was
protesting with screams as piercing as those of a
locomotive in distress, that the car wheeled into
the highroad and narrowly missed a dog-cart
coming up from Seaford. As they passed, Edward's
hand went to his hat, for the driver of the
dog-cart was Miss Davenant.</div>

<p>Charles, partially released, leaped toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
lady, only to hang by his chain over the edge of
the car. By the time he had been hauled in again
and cuffed into comparative quiescence Miss
Davenant was left far behind, a little, gesticulating
figure against the horizon. Her gestures
seemed to Edward to be gestures of recall. But
he disregarded them. It was not till later that
he regretted this.</p>

<p>A final struggle with Charles ended in victory,
not because Edward had enforced his will on that
strong and strenuous nature, but because Charles
was now exhausted and personally inclined to
surrender. He lay at last on the floor of the car,
his jaws open in a wide, white-toothed smile,
and his pink tongue palpitating to his panting
breaths. Edward sat very upright, his hands
between his knees, holding the shortened chain of
Charles. Mile after mile of the smooth down
country slipped past, the car had whirled down
the narrow, tree-bordered road into Alfreston, past
the old church and the thirteenth-century, half-timbered
Clergy House, where three little girls in
green pinafores were seeking to coerce a reluctant
goat along to Polegate and across the railway
lines, and still Mr. Basingstoke never moved.
His mind alone was alive, and of his body he was
no longer conscious. He thought and thought and
thought. Why had she left the farm? Had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
been frightened? Had she been captured? Where
had she gone? And why? And behind all these
questions was a background of something too
vague and yet too complicated to be called regret&mdash;or
something which, translated into words, might
have gone something like this:</p>

<p>"Adventures to the adventurous. And three
days ago the world was before me. I had set out
for adventures and I found nothing more agitating
than the pleasant pleasing of one little child. Then
suddenly the adventure happened. And now no
more charming wanderings, no more aimless saunterings
in this pleasant, green world, but rush and
worry and hurry and dust, uncertainty, anxiety, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
whole pretty dream of the adventurer
shattered by the reality of the adventure."</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without meaning to do it, he had
mortgaged his future to a stranger. The stranger
had fled and he was&mdash;well, not pursuing, but going
to the place she had named as that from which
he might gain a clue and take up the pursuit. It
was not exactly regret, but Mr. Basingstoke found
himself almost wishing that time could move backward
and set him in the meadow where the red
wall was, and give him once more the chance to
fly or not to fly his aeroplane. Perhaps if he had
the choice he would not fly it. But all this was
among the shadows at the back of his mind. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the foreground was the small, insistent cycle of
questions: Why had she left the farm? Had she
been frightened? Had she been captured? Where
had she gone? When? How? Why?</p>

<p>It was not till the car was slipping through
Crowborough, that paradise of villa-dwellers who
have "done well in business," that the thought
came to him, had she, after all, gone back to her
aunt? Had she thought better of it, and just
gone humbly back with confession and submission
in both hands? It was then that he remembered
that Miss Davenant had seemed to signal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
perhaps she had some errand to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps
submission had been given as the price of a farewell
message, aunt-borne, to meet him at the
farm? Mr. Basingstoke was not subject to attacks
of indecision, but now for a moment he
wavered. Then imagination showed him himself
on the door-step of the Hall asking for Miss Davenant,
and Miss Davenant receiving or not receiving
him&mdash;in either case he himself cutting a
figure which he could not for a moment admire.
Common sense reinforced imagination. The handkerchief
said General Post-Office. It could only
have said that if the handkerchief's owner meant
him to go to the General Post-Office. If the handkerchief's
owner had meant him to go back to
the Hall, the handkerchief could just as easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
have said the Hall. He went back to his questionings,
and the car drew near Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>Charles, exhausted by the morning's combat,
had slept heavily, but now he roused himself to
take the rôle of Arbiter of Destinies. He roused
himself, sat up, snuffled and blew, and then, with
wide smile and lolling tongue, proclaimed himself
to be that pitiable and suffering creature, a bull-terrier
dying of thirst. In vain Edward sought to
calm him; he insisted that he was, and that he
had a right to be, thirsty. His insistence affected
his master. Edward became aware that he, also,
was thirsty; more, was hungry. His watch
showed him that the chauffeur had every right to
consider himself an ill-used man. A bright-faced
hotel whose windows were underlined with marguerites
and pink geraniums beckoned attractively.</p>

<p>"After all, one must live," said Edward, and
breathed an order. The car drew up in front of
the White Horse.</p>

<p>Another car was there&mdash;unattended&mdash;a very
nice car. Edward wished it had been his. It
had all those charms which his own hired one
lacked, and his experienced eye dwelt fondly on
those charms.</p>

<p>"Get yourself something to eat," he said to the
chauffeur. Charles, straining toward the horse-trough,
seemed anxious to prove that his thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had not been simulated. Edward indulged him.
Arrived at the wet granite, however, Charles
lapped a tongueful or two, as it were out of politeness
and merely to oblige, and then looked up
at his master expressively. "You have sadly misunderstood
me," he seemed to say. "What I
wanted was breakfast," adding, reproachfully,
"You will remember that there has been none
to-day."</p>

<p>He dragged his master to the hotel door, where
they passed in under hanging-baskets of pink and
white flowers, and in a coffee-room adorned with
trophies of the chase Edward ordered luncheon
for himself and biscuits for Charles. Now mark
the vagaries of Destiny: Charles, impatient for
the biscuits, dragged his chain about the coffee-room,
empty at this hour of all but himself and
his master; he upset the tongs and the shovel and
brought them clattering to the fender. Edward
replaced them in their stands. Then Charles put
his feet in an antimacassar and dragged it to the
floor. After this he went to the writing-table
under the wire blind in the middle window and
snuffled curiously in the waste-paper basket, upsetting
it almost without an effort, and a litter
of letters and envelopes and torn circulars was
discharged.</p>

<p>Edward, hastening to repair these ravages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
scooped the torn fragments in his hands&mdash;and on
the very top, fronting him, was an envelope bearing
his own name&mdash;Basingstoke.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Basingstoke," the envelope said plainly,
adding as an incomplete afterthought, "General
Post-O"&mdash;and there ending. The handwriting
was, like Hypatia's, graceful and self-conscious.
That is to say, it was legible, clear, and the letters
were shaped by design and not by accident. He
never doubted for an instant whose hand it was
that had written those words. He went through
the waste-paper basket's other contents for more
of that handwriting. There was not a scrap.
The waiter, coming in with accessories to the still-withheld
luncheon, stared at him.</p>

<p>"Something thrown away by mistake," he said,
and pursued the search. No&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>But that she had been here was plain; that she
still might be here was possible. She must have
come by train or by motor&mdash;what motor? Train
from what station? He went out into the hall to
question the highly coiffured young lady whom he
had noticed as he came in, the lady who sits in the
glass cage where the keys are kept, and enters
your name in the book when you engage your
room. The cage was empty, the hall was empty.
On the hall-table's dark mahogany lay a shining
salver, and on the salver lay a few letters. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
picked them up. The one on the top was addressed
fully&mdash;to</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Basingstoke</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">General Post-Office,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">London.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The one below was addressed to&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Miss Davenant</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Hall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Jevington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Sussex.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Edward glanced round; he was still alone. He
put the letters in his pocket and went back to the
coffee-room. Charles's attentions had been directed,
in his absence, to the waiter, who had thus
been detained from his duties.</div>

<p>"Any one else lunching here to-day?" he asked,
restraining Charles.</p>

<p>"Mostly over by now, sir," said the waiter.
"That dog&mdash;dangerous, ain't he, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Edward; "he only took a
fancy to you."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't let me pass&mdash;like," said the waiter.</p>

<p>"Only his play," said Edward. "He merely
wants his dinner. You've been rather a long time
bringing his biscuits. I expect he thought you'd
got them in your pocket."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sorry, sir," the waiter said, and explained that,
being single-handed at that hour, he had had to
attend to the other party's lunch, "in the garden,
sir," he added, "though why the garden when
everything's nice and ready in here&mdash;to say nothing
of earwigs in your glass, and beetles, and everything
to be carried half a mile&mdash;" He ceased
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the garden," said Edward,
"while I'm waiting."</p>

<p>"Lunch ready directly, sir," said the waiter.
"Hardly worth while to have it out there now,
sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which way?" Edward asked, and was told.
He went through the hall, under a vine-covered
trellis, and the garden blazed before him&mdash;a really
charming garden, all green and red and yellow;
beyond the lawn was an arbor with a light network
of hops above it. In that arbor was a white-spread
table. There was also movement; people
were seated at the table.</p>

<p>Edward stood in the sunshine between two tall
vases overflowing with nasturtiums and lobelias
and opened his letter.</p>

<p>"Good-by," it said, "and thank you a thousand
times. I shall never forget your kindness. But
when I had time to think I saw that it wasn't
fair to you. But you showed me the way out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the trap. And, now I am free, I can go on by
myself. I don't want to drag you into any
bother there may be. It would be a poor return
for your kindness."</p>

<p>Initials followed&mdash;"K. D."</p>

<p>Mr. Basingstoke dragged at the chain of Charles,
who was already gardening industrially in a bed
of begonias, and walked straight to the arbor.
It could not, of course, be she whose skirt he saw
through the dappled screen of leaf and shadow.
The waiter would never have called her a "party"&mdash;still,
one might as well make sure before one
began to make inquiries of the hotel people. So
he walked around to the arbor's entrance and
looked in. A man and woman were seated with a
little table between them; coffee, peaches, and
red wine announced the meal's completion. The
man was a stranger. The woman was Herself.
She raised her eyes as he darkened the doorway
and they stared at each other for an instant in a
stricken silence. It was a terrible moment for
Edward. Recognition might be the falsest of
false steps. On the other hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The question
was, of course, one that must be left to her
to decide. The man with her was too young to
be her father; he might, of course, be an uncle or
a brother. Untimely recognition on Edward's
part might mean the end of all things. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
only a moment, though an incredibly long one.
Then she smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "here you are!" And before
Edward had time to wonder what his next move
was, or was expected to be, she had turned to her
companion and said, "This is my brother; he
will be able to thank you better than I can for
your kindness."</p>

<p>The stranger, a strongly built man with blue
eyes and a red neck, looked from one to the other.
It may have been Mr. Basingstoke's fancy, but
to him it seemed that the stranger's glance was
seeking that elusive thing, a family likeness. His
look said that he did not find it. His voice said,</p>

<p>"Not at all. Delighted to have been of the
slightest service."</p>

<p>"What's happened?" asked Edward, feeling his
way.</p>

<p>"Why," she hastened to explain, "when you
didn't turn up I started to walk, and I didn't
put on sensible shoes." A foot shod in a worn
satin slipper crept out to point the confession and
vanished at once. "And I sat down on a heap of
stones to wait for you. And then this gentleman
came by and offered me a lift. And I couldn't
think what had become of you&mdash;and you know
how important it was to get to London&mdash;so, of
course, I was most grateful. And then something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
went wrong with the motor, so we stopped
here for lunch&mdash;and I can't think how you found
me&mdash;but I'm so glad you did. And all's well
that ends well."</p>

<p>Edward felt that he was scowling, and all his
efforts could not smooth out the scowl. She was
patting Charles and looking at Charles's master.</p>

<p>"We are very much indebted to you, sir," said
Edward, coldly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I assure you," said the gentleman
with the red neck. "Only too happy to be of service
to Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Basingstoke," said Edward, and saw in her
eyes that he had not done the right thing. "I
suppose you forgot to write to Aunt Emily and
Uncle James," he said, seeking to retrieve the last
move.</p>

<p>"Indeed I didn't," she said, with plain relief.
"I wrote directly I got here, and gave them to
the waiter to post."</p>

<p>Another silence longer than the first was broken
by the waiter, who came to announce that the
gentleman's lunch was ready in the coffee-room.
The other gentleman&mdash;red-necked&mdash;asked for his
bill.</p>

<p>While the waiter was gone for it, Edward put a
sovereign on the table. "For my sister's share,"
he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The red-necked gentleman protested.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, in a low voice, "I said
I should pay my share."</p>

<p>The red-necked gentleman rose. "I will tell
them," he said, "to make out your bill separately.
And now, if I cannot be of any further service to
you, I think I'll be getting on. Good day to you."</p>

<p>"Good day," said Edward, "and thank you for
your kindness to my sister."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said she, "and thank you a thousand
times." She held out her hand. He bowed
over it and went away through the sunlit garden,
resentment obvious in every line of his back.</p>

<p>Neither Edward nor the girl spoke. There was
no sound in the arbor save the convulsive gulpings
of Charles absorbing the sponge fingers which she
absently offered him from among the scattered
dessert.</p>

<p>It was she who broke the silence. "I did write,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I got the letter." He laid it and Miss
Davenant's on the table. "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"What it says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't let <em>me</em> help you&mdash;but you let that
man, right enough."</p>

<p>"What was I to do? The important thing was
to get away."</p>

<p>"What tale did you tell that man?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"The truth."</p>

<p>He scowled with bitter skepticism.</p>

<p>"I did. Except that you're not my brother. I
told him I'd missed you and that I'd got to get to
London to-day as early as I could. And he was
awfully nice and kind."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it."</p>

<p>"<em>Nice</em> and kind," she repeated, with emphasis.
"And you were most horrid to him. And I do
think you're unkind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be," said Edward, "and it's
not my province to be horrid and unkind to you,
any more than it is to be nice and kind. In this
letter you say good-by. Am I to understand that
you mean good-by&mdash;that I am to leave you, here&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and there was that in her
silence which laid a healing touch on his hurt
vanity.</p>

<p>"If my manner doesn't please you," he went
on, "do remember that you have brought a fairly
solid Spanish castle about my ears and that I am
still a little bewildered and bruised."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but I didn't think."</p>

<p>"You see," he went on, "I thought I'd found
a girl who wasn't just like other girls.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am," she said&mdash;"just."</p>

<p>"I thought that you were brave and truthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and strong&mdash;and that you trusted me; and then
I find you haven't the courage to stick to the way
we planned; you haven't even the courage to wait
for me and tell me you've changed your mind.
You bolt off like a frightened rabbit and make
friends with the first bounder who comes along.
I was a fool to think I could help you. You don't
need my help. Anybody else can help you just
as well. Good-by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said, not looking up. And he
perceived that she was weeping. Also that he was
no longer angry.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he said, "oh, don't! Do forgive me.
I don't know what I've said. But I didn't mean
it, whatever it was, if it's hurt you. I'll do just
what you say. Shall I call that chap back?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said again. "Oh, don't cry!
I'm not worth it. Nothing's worth it. Charles,
you brute, lie down." For Charles, in eager sympathy
with beauty in distress, was leaping up in
vain efforts to find and kiss the hidden face.</p>

<p>"Don't scold him," she said. "I like him." And
Edward could have worshiped her for the words.
"And, oh," she said, after a minute, "don't scold
me, either! I'm so frightfully tired and everything's
been so hateful. I thought you'd understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and that if you cared to find me, you
would."</p>

<p>"How could I? You sent no address."</p>

<p>"I did. On the handkerchief.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I suppose
you couldn't read it."</p>

<p>"And still," he said, but quite gently now, "I
don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you? Don't you see, I thought when
you'd had time to think it over you'd be sorry
and wish yourself well out of it, and yet feel
obliged to go on. And I thought how horrid for
you. And how much easier for you if you just
thought I'd changed my mind. And then I set
out to walk to Seaford and take the train. And
then my shoes gave out, and I was so awfully
afraid of aunt coming along that way, so that when
Mr. Schultz came along it seemed a perfect godsend."</p>

<p>"So that's his foreign and unhappy name?" said
Edward. "How did he come to tell it to you?"</p>

<p>"He had to," she said. "I borrowed ten pounds
of him. I couldn't have gone to Claridge's without
money, you know."</p>

<p>"Why Claridge's?"</p>

<p>"It's the only hotel that I know. And I had to
have his name and address to send it back."</p>

<p>"May I send it back this afternoon?" Edward
asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you take back all you said in the letter?
You don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Not if you didn't want me to."</p>

<p>"And it wasn't really only because you thought
I.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Of course. At least.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Mr. Basingstoke, happily, "it
never happened. I fetched you as we arranged.
We go on as we arranged. And Mr. Schultz is
only a bad dream to which I owe ten pounds."</p>

<p>"And you're not angry? Then will you lend
me some money to buy a hat, and then we will go
straight on to London."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edward, controlling Charles, who
had just seen the peaches and thought they
looked like something to eat. "But&mdash;if you won't
think me a selfish brute I should like to say just
one thing."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" She wrinkled her brows apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Neither Charles nor I have had any luncheon.
Would you very much mind if we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how hateful of me not to remember!" she
said. "Let me come and talk to you and feed
Charles. What a darling he is! And you do forgive
me, and you do understand? And we're
friends again, just as we were before?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Just as we were."</p>

<p>"It's curious," she said, as they went back
through the red and green and blue and yellow of
the garden, "that I feel as though I knew you ever
so much better, now we've quarreled."</p>

<p>Mr. Schultz had, it appeared, after all, paid for
the two luncheons. Edward sent him two ten-pound
notes and the sovereign, "with compliments
and thanks."</p>

<p>"And that's the end of poor Mr. Schultz," she
said, gaily, and, as it proved, with complete
inaccuracy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ROAD TO &mdash;&mdash;</div>


<div class='cap'>THE drive to London was a silent one. Mr.
Basingstoke did not want to talk; he had
come on one of those spaces where the emotions
sleep, exhausted. He felt nothing any more,
neither anxiety as to the future nor pleasure at
the nearness of the furry heap beside him under
which, presently, his companion slumbered peacefully
as a babe in its cot. His mind was blank, his
heart was numbed; it was not till the car reached
the houses spilled over the pretty fields like ugly
toys emptied out of the play-box of a giant child,
that mind or heart made any movement. Then it
happened that the breeze caught the edge of the
fur and lifted it, and he saw her little face softly
flushed with sleep, lying very near him, and his
heart seemed all at once to come to life again with
an awakening stab of something that was not
affection or even passion, but a kind of protective
exultation&mdash;a deep, keen longing to take care of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to guard, to infold safely from all possible dangers
and sorrows her who slept so happy-helpless beside
him. Then his mind awoke, too, and he
found himself wondering. The Schultz episode,
his suspicions, resentment&mdash;the explication&mdash;all
this should, one would have thought, have
brushed, like a rough hand, the bloom from the
adventure. And, instead of taking anything away,
it had, even as she had said, added a soft touch
of intimacy to their friendship. Further, he now
in his heart had the memory that, for an instant,
his thoughts had wronged her, that he had suspected
her of wavering, almost of light-mindedness,
though his thought had taken no such definite
lines even to itself in its secret heart&mdash;and all the
time there had only been thought for him, sincere,
delicate consideration, and, in the matter of that
man's accepted help, the trust of a child, and that
innocence of Una before which even lions like
Schultz become shy and safe. Imagine a subject
who has suspected his princess of being, perhaps,
not a princess at all, but one masquerading in the
robes and crown of a princess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when he shall
find her to be indeed royal, to what an ecstasy of
loyalty will not his heart attain? So it was now
with Mr. Basingstoke. He caught the corner of
the fur and reverently covered the face of his
princess.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the houses were thick and the shops
began to score the streets with lines of color. He
stopped at one of those big shops where they sell
everything, and she awoke and said, "Are we
there?"</p>

<p>"I thought," said he, "that you said something
about a hat."</p>

<p>"Here?" she said, looking at the shop with
strong distaste.</p>

<p>"Better here than really in London, I thought.
And you'll want other things. And do you mind
buying a box or a portmanteau or something?
Because hotels like you to have luggage."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking&mdash;" she said, but he interrupted
her.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, "but even you cannot
think your best thoughts when you're asleep."</p>

<p>Then she laughed. "Well, you must give me
the money," she said, holding out a bare, unashamed
hand, "because I haven't any."</p>

<p>He composed himself to wait, and he waited a
long time, a very, very long time. He cheered the
waiting by the thought that she could not, after
all, have found the shop so unsuitable as it had,
at the first glance, seemed. He watched the doorway,
and his eye became weary of the useless
snippets of lace and silk at something eleven-three
with which the windows at each side of the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
were plastered. He noticed the people who went
in, and the many more who waited outside and
longed for these absurd decorations&mdash;longed with
that passion which, almost alone of the passions,
a girl may display to the utmost immoderation
without fear of censure or of shame. He observed
the longing in the eyes of little, half-developed,
half-grown girls for this or that bit of worthless
frippery; he would have liked to call to them and
say, "My dear children, do go in and buy yourself
each a fairing, and let me pay." But he knew
that so straightforward and simple a kindness
would draw on him and on the children shame and
censure almost immeasurable. So he just sat and
was sorry for them, till he saw two of them titter
together and look at him.</p>

<p>Then he got out of the car and went into the
shop&mdash;they sold toys there as well as everything
else&mdash;to buy something himself. He could not
find exactly what he wanted&mdash;in shops crowded
with glittering uselessnesses it is rarely that you
can find the particular uselessness on which you
have set your heart&mdash;but Tommy of the Five
Bells had no fault to find with the big, brown-papered
parcel which reached him by the next
day's afternoon post. He could not imagine any
soldiers more perfectly satisfying than these,
no bricks more solid and square, no drafts more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
neatly turned, no dominoes more smoothly finished.
To Mr. Basingstoke's old nurse the world
seemed to hold nothing fairer than the lace collar
and the violet-silk necktie. "Do me for Sundays
for years," she said, putting them back in their
tissue-paper and turning her attention to the box
of sweets and the stockings for the children. The
girl who sold Mr. Basingstoke the lace collar
sniggered apart with a kindred sniggerer as she
sold it to him, and delayed to make out his bill,
but the other girl, almost a child, with a black
bow tying her hair, sold him the stockings and
was sympathetic and helpful.</p>

<p>"How many stockings ought a child to have, so
as to have plenty?" he asked her, confidentially.
At the lace-counter he had made his own choice,
in stern silence.</p>

<p>"Three pairs," said the girl; "that's one in wear,
one in the wash, and one in case of accidents."
She glanced through the glass door at the motor,
and decided that he could afford it. "But, of
course, four would be better."</p>

<p>"I should think six would be best," said he,
"that's one for each day in the week, and on
Saturday they can stay in bed while their mother
does the washing."</p>

<p>"You don't wash on Saturdays," said the girl,
her little, plain face lighting up with a smile. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
saw the eye of the shop-walker on her and added,
nervously, "Shall we say six, then, sir; and what
size? I mean what aged child? About what
price?"</p>

<p>"Three to eleven," said he.</p>

<p>"They're one and eleven-three," said she.</p>

<p>"I mean the children, not the stockings&mdash;there
are five of them&mdash;what's five sixes?"</p>

<p>"Thirty," the girl told him, with a glance at the
shop-walker that was almost defiant in its triumph.</p>

<p>"That's it, then," said he, "and sort out the
sizes properly, please, will you? Three six, two
sevens, ten and eleven. And put in some garters&mdash;children's
stockings are always coming down,
you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl had not before sold garters to insane
but agreeable gentlemen. She hesitated and said
in a low voice, "I don't think garters, sir. Suspenders
are more worn now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, suspenders then. The means doesn't
matter&mdash;it's the keeping up that's the important
thing." He laid a five-pound note on the counter,
just as the shop-walker came up to her with a
slightly insolent, "Serving, Miss Moore?"</p>

<p>"Sign, sir," said Miss Moore, defending herself
from his displeasure with the bill. "Anything
more, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want some sweets," said Edward, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
directed to "the third shop on the left, through
there."</p>

<p>It was not till two weeks later that a satined
and beribboned box of sweets arrived by post for
Miss Moore. "From Mary," said the legend
within, and the postmark was Warwick. Mr.
Basingstoke counted on every one's having at
least one relation or friend bearing that commonest
and most lovely of all names. And he was
right. A distant cousin got the credit of the
gift, which made the little apprentice happy for a
day and interested for a week&mdash;exactly as Mr. Basingstoke
had intended. His imagination pleased
him with the picture of the sudden surprise of
a gift, in that drab and subordinated life. By such
simple means Mr. Basingstoke added enormously
to his own agreeable sensations. And by such
little exercises of memory as that which registered
Miss Moore's name and the address of the
shop he made those pleasures possible for himself.
The sweets he bought on that first day of his
elopement went to his nurse. He might have
added more gifts, for the pleasure of spending
money was still as new as nice, but the voice of
Charles without drew him from the shop to settle
a difference of opinion between that tethered dog
and the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Wanted to hang hisself over the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
car," the man explained, "and no loss to his
mourning relations, if you ask me," he added,
sourly.</p>

<p>Edward had hardly adjusted the situation before
she came out&mdash;and he felt the sight of her
was worth waiting for. She wore now a white
coat with touches of black velvet, and the hat
was white, too, with black and a pink rose or
two.</p>

<p>"It looks more like Bond Street than Peckham,"
he said as she got in. "It surpasses my wildest
dreams."</p>

<p>"I had to make them trim it," she said, "that's
why I was such ages. All the ones they had
were like Madge Wildfire&mdash;insane, wild, unrelated
feathers and bows born in Bedlam."</p>

<p>Her eyes, under the brim of the new hat, thrilled
him, and when Charles, leaping on her lap,
knocked the hat crooked, scattered the mound of
parcels, and made rosetted dust-marks on the
new cloak, her reception of these clumsy advances
would have endeared her to any one to whom she
was not already dear.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, tucking Charles in between
them, setting the hat straight, and dusting the
coat, all in one competent movement, "have you
had time yet to think what you're going to do
with me?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have had time," he said, rearranging the
mound.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry I was so long, but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"It was worth it," he said, looking at the hat.
"Well, what I propose is that you should go, not
to Claridge's, which is just the place where your
relations will look for you, but to one of those
large, comfortable hotels where strictly middle-class
people stay when they come up to London
on matters connected with their shops or their
farms. I will give you as long as you like to unpack
your new portmanteau and your parcels.
Then I'll call for you and take you out to dinner."</p>

<p>"But I thought we were going on tramp," she
objected.</p>

<p>"Dinner first, tramping afterward," he said,
"a long while afterward. I don't propose to let
you tramp in those worldly shoes." They were
new and brown and soft to look at&mdash;as soft as
other people's gloves, he thought.</p>

<p>"Don't dress for dinner," he said as they drew
up in front of the Midlothian Hotel. "And, I
say, I expect it would be safer to dine here; it's
absolutely the last place where any of your people
would look for you."</p>

<p>The dress in which she rejoined him later was
a walking-dress of dark blue melting to a half
transparency at neck and sleeves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I bought it at that shop," she said. "It isn't
bad, is it? They said it was a Paris model&mdash;and,
anyhow, it fits."</p>

<p>He wanted to tell her that she looked adorable
in it, and that she would look adorable not only
in a Paris model, but in a Whitechapel one. But
he didn't tell her this. Nor did he tell her much
else. The dinner owed to her any brightness that
it showed when shelved as a memory. She exerted
herself to talk. And it was the talk of a
lady to her dinner partner&mdash;light, gay, and sparkling,
anything but intimate&mdash;hardly friendly, even;
polite, pleasant, indifferent. He did not like it;
he did not like, either, his own inability to carry
on the duet in the key she had set, and at the same
time he knew that he could not change the key.
The surge of the world was round them again,
even though it was only the world of the provincial
haberdasher and the haberdasher's provincial wife.
The smooth, swift passage of laden waiters across
the thick carpets of the dining-room; the little
tables gay with pink sweet-peas and rosy-hued
lamps; the women in smart blouses, most of them
sparkling beadily; the rare evening toilettes, worn
in every case with an air of conscious importance,
as of one to whom wearing evening dress was a
rare and serious exception to the rule of life; the
buzz of conversation curiously softer and lower in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pitch than the talk at the Ritz and the Carlton&mdash;all
made an atmosphere of opposition, an atmosphere
in which all that appeared socially impossible&mdash;which,
under the stars last night, had
seemed natural, inevitable&mdash;the only thing to do.
This world to which he had brought her had, at
least, this in common with the world which dines
at the Carlton and the Ritz, that it bristled with
the negation of what last night had seemed the
simplest solution in the world. But it had only
seemed simple, as he now saw, because the solution
had been arrived at out of the world. Here,
beyond any doubt, was the antagonism to all
that he and she had planned. This was the world
where the worst scandal is the unusual&mdash;where it
would be less socially blighting to steal another
man's wife than to set off on a tramp with a
princess to whom you were tied neither by marriage
nor by kinship.</p>

<p>It was a lengthy silence in which he thought
these things. She, in the silence, had been making
little patterns with bread-crumbs till the waiter
swept all away, made their table tidy, and brought
the dessert. She looked up from the table-cloth
just in time to see Edward smile grimly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, a little timidly.</p>

<p>"I was only thinking," he said, "what a two-penny
halfpenny business we've made of life, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
our electric light and our motors and our ugly
houses and our civilization generally. A civilization
replete with every modern inconvenience! In
the good old days nobody would have minded a
knight and a princess traveling through the world
together, or even around the world, for that matter.
Whereas now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>She looked at him, gauging this thought. And
he knew that he had said enough to make a stupid
woman say, "I thought you would want to
back out of it." What would she say? For a
moment she said nothing. Then, sure of herself
as of him, she smiled and said:</p>

<p>"We're going to teach Nobody to mind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
its own business."</p>

<p>And then he said what he had come near to
being afraid she would say.</p>

<p>"You don't want to back out of it, then?" he
said, and she shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, slowly, and then, after a
pause, again, "No."</p>

<p>"You are willing to go through the wood with
your faithful knight, Princess? He will be a
faithful knight."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I know."</p>

<p>And then suddenly he perceived what before
had not been plain to him&mdash;that the elopement
that had seemed to offer so royal a road to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that he really desired was not a road, but a
barrier. That he was now in a position far less
advantageous than that of a man who meets a
girl all hedged around with the machinery of
chaperonage, since, whereas the courtship may,
where there is chaperonage, evade and escape it,
where there is none the lover must himself supply
its need&mdash;must, in fine, be lover and chaperon in
one. Far from placing himself in a position where
love-making would be easy, he had set himself
where it was well-nigh impossible. He who courts
a lady in her own home, surrounded by all the
fences set up by custom and convention, can, at
least, be sure that if his courtship be unwelcome it
will be rejected. The lady need not listen unless
she will. But when the princess rides through the
wood with the knight whom she has chosen to
be her champion she must needs listen if he
chooses to speak. She can, of course, leave him
and his championing, but what sort of championship
is it which drives the princess back to the
very dragon from which it rescued her? Edward
saw, with dismal exactness, the intolerable impossibilities
of the situation. They would go on&mdash;supposing
her friends didn't interfere&mdash;as friends
and comrades, brother and sister, she more and
more friendly, he more and more tongue-tied, till
at last every spark of the fire of the great adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was trampled out by the flat foot of
habit.</p>

<p>She might&mdash;and probably would, since men and
women invariably misunderstand one another&mdash;believe
his delicate reticences to be merely the indications
of a waning interest, and construe knightly
chivalry into mere indifference. If he made love
to her&mdash;who could not get away from the love-making
without destroying that which made it
possible&mdash;he would be a presuming cad. If he
didn't, what could she think but that he regretted
his bargain? As he sat there opposite his princess,
alone with her among the thickly thinning crowd,
he wondered whether out of this any happiness
could come to them.</p>

<p>When he had proposed the elopement he had
meant marriage; the incurable temperamental
generosity which had prompted him to offer her
the help of the escape, on her own terms, now
seemed to him the grossest folly. Yet how could
he have held the pistol to her head, saying, "No
marriage, no elopement."</p>

<p>Her voice broke his reverie. "I am very tired,"
she said. "I think I'll say good night. Do you
mind?"</p>

<p>He almost fancied that her lip trembled a little,
like a child's who is unhappy.</p>

<p>"Of course you're tired," he said, "and, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
you don't mind my not having talked for the last
few minutes? I've been thinking of you&mdash;nothing
else but you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "it all looks very different
here, as you say. Perhaps it will look more different
even than this to-morrow. Shall we start
on our tramp to-morrow&mdash;or shall I just go back
and let's forget we ever tried to do something out
of a book? I think you will tell me honestly to-morrow
whether you think I had better go back."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said, looking into her eyes,
"I will tell you everything you wish to hear.
We'll spend to-morrow in telling each other things.
Shall we? Good night, Princess. Sleep well, and
dream of the open road."</p>

<p>"I shall probably," said the princess, "dream
of my aunts."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MEDWAY</div>


<div class='cap'>"IF you had a map and I could put my finger
on any place I chose, I should open my eyes
the least bit in the world and put my finger on
the Thames," she said at the breakfast-table,
where she had for the first time sat opposite to
him and poured his coffee, looking as demurely
domestic as any haberdasher's wife of them all.</div>

<p>"The Thames?" he said. "I know a river worth
two of that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"A river that's worth two of the Thames must
be the river of Paradise."</p>

<p>"So it is," he assured her, "and probably the
Thames is infested by your relations. For a serious
and secret conference such as we propose to
ourselves there is no place like the Medway."</p>

<p>She had thought the Medway to be nothing but
mud and barges, and said so.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's below Maidstone. Above&mdash; But
you'll see. Wear a shady hat and bring that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
conspirator-looking cloak you wore last night&mdash;the
fine weather can't possibly last forever.
Twenty minutes for breakfast, half an hour for a
complete river toilette, and we catch the ten-seventeen
from Cannon Street, easily."</p>

<p>"I haven't a complete river toilette. And you?
I thought you left all your possessions at the
Five Bells&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not the homeless orphan you deem me,"
he said, accepting kidneys and bacon from a
sleepy waiter. "I have a home, though a humble
one, and, what's more, it's just around the corner&mdash;Montague
Street, to be exact. Next door
to the British Museum. So central, is it not?
Some inward monitor whispered to me, 'She will
want to go on the river,' and I laid out the complete
boating-man's costume, down to white shoes
with new laces."</p>

<p>"Did you really think I should think of the
river? How clever of you."</p>

<p>"I am clever," he said, modestly, "and good.
It is better to be good than clever. That is why
I cannot conceal from you that I never thought
of the river till you spoke about it. But I really
have some flannels, little as you may think it, and
we'll stop and get some boating-shoes for you, if
you want them. Only you'll have to buy them
with lightning speed and change them at Yalding."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that the name of the place? How lovely!
If I had a title I should like it to be Lady Yalding&mdash;or
the Duchess of Yalding. Her Grace the
Duchess of Yalding will give you some more coffee,
if you like."</p>

<p>"Why come down in the world? You were a
princess last night."</p>

<p>"Princess of where?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We will give a morning to a proper definition
of the boundaries of your territory one of these
days. Meantime, are you aware that I don't even
know the name by which the common world
knows you?"</p>

<p>"I know you don't," she said, "and I'd much
rather you didn't. If I'm to be a princess I'll be
the Princess of Yalding, and if she has to have
another name we'll choose a new one. I should
like everything to be new for our new adventure."</p>

<p>They got the shoes and they caught the train,
and, now the little gritty walk from Yalding station
was over, they stood on the landing-stage of the
Anchor, looking down on a sort of Sargasso Sea
of small craft that stretched along below the edge
of the Anchor garden.</p>

<p>"The canoe would be nice," she said.</p>

<p>"It would not be nice with Charles," he said,
firmly. "Charles's first conscious act after we became
each other's was to upset me out of a canoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the heartless delight of three picnic parties,
four pairs of sweethearts, two dons, and a personal
friend."</p>

<p>"If Charles is to come <em>in</em> the boat," she said,
"perhaps that fishing-punt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Water within, water without," he said, spurning
the water-logged punt. "This little sculling-boat
will do. No&mdash;no outriggers for us, thank
you," he said to the Anchor's gloomy boatman,
who came toward them like a sort of fresh-water
Neptune with a boat-hook for trident.</p>

<p>"He might, at least, have smiled," she said, as
the sour-faced Neptune man turned toward the
boat-house. "I hope he'll give us red cushions
and a nice, 'arty sort of carpet."</p>

<p>"You get no carpets here," he assured her.
"Lucky if we have so much as a strip of cocoanut
matting. This is not the languid, luxurious
Thames. On the Medway life is real, life is
earnest. You mostly pull a hundred yards, anchor
and fish; or if you do go farther from harbor you
open your own locks, with your own crowbar.
The best people are always a bit shabby. You and
I, no doubt, are the cynosure of every eye. Yes,
that'll do; we'll put the basket in the stern, then
the ginger-beer here. We'll put the cloak over it
to keep it cool. All right, thank you. Crowbar in?
Right. Throw in the painter. Right."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Neptune pushed them with his trident and the
boat swung out into midstream. A few strokes
took them out of sight of the Anchor, its homely,
flowered garden, its thatched house, its hornbeam
arbor; they passed, too, the ugly, bare house that
some utilitarian misdemeanant has built next to
it, then nothing but depths of willow copse, green
and gray, and the grassy curves of the towing-path
where the loosestrife grows, and the willow
herb, the yellow yarrow, and the delicate plumes
of the meadow-sweet.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'>he quoted.</div>

<p>"It's like a passport," she said&mdash;"or finding that
you haven't lost your ticket, after all&mdash;when
people have read the same things and remembered
them. But don't you love the bit that begins
about 'the tempestuous moon in early June,'
and ends up with the 'uncrumpling fern and
scent of hay new-mown'? I wonder why it is that
when people quote poetry in books you feel that
they're Laura-Matilda-ish, and when they do it
really you quite like it. Do you write poetry?"</p>

<p>He looked at her guiltily. "Look out to the
left," he said; "there's an absolutely perfect
thatched barn, and four oast-houses&mdash;you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
where they dry the hops, with little fires of oak
chips. Have you ever been in an oast-house?
We will some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was silent as the boat slipped past the old
farm buildings, the old trees, the long perfection
of the barn, and the deep red and green of the
mossy oast-house wall going down sheer to the
smooth, brown water, and hung at crevice and
cranny with little ferns and little flowers&mdash;herb-robert
and stonecrop. The reflection, till his
oars shattered it, was as perfect as the building
itself, and she drew a deep breath and turned to
look back as the boat slid past.</p>

<p>"You were right," she said, "it is a darling
little river. And you <em>do</em> write poetry, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Is this the confessional or the Medway?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I know you do," she said. "Of course you
do&mdash;everybody does, as well as they can, I suppose;
I can't, but I do," she added, encouragingly.
"We will write poems for each other, on wet
nights in the caravan, about Nature and Fate
and Destiny, and things like that&mdash;won't we?"</p>

<p>The quiet river, wandering by wood and
meadow, bordered by its fringe of blossoms and
flowering grasses, the smooth backwaters where
leaning trees touched hands across the glassy
mirror, and water-lilies gleamed white and starry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the dappled shadows, the arch of blue sky, the
gay sunshine, and the peace of the summer noon
all wrought in one fine spell to banish from their
thoughts all fear and dismay, all doubts and hesitations.
Here they were, two human beings&mdash;young,
healthy, happy&mdash;with all fair things before
them and all sad things behind. It seemed to
them both, at that moment, that they need ask
nothing more of life than a long chain of days like
this. They were silent, and each felt in the other's
silence no embarrassment or weariness, but only
a serene content. Even Charles, overcome by
the spirit of the hour, was silent, slumbering on
the matting between them, in heavy abandonment.</p>

<p>The perfection of their surroundings left them
free to catch the delicate flavor of the wonderful
adventure&mdash;a flavor which the dust and hurry of
yesterday had disguised and distorted a little.</p>

<p>He looked at her and thought, "It is worth
while&mdash;it is indeed worth while"&mdash;and knew that
if only the princess were for his winning the moment
of rashness which only yesterday he had
almost regretted would be in its result the most
fortunate moment of his life.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and a little fear lifted its
head and stung her like a snake. What if he were
to regret the adventure? What if he were to like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
her less and less&mdash;she put it to herself like that&mdash;while
she grew to like him more and more? She
looked at his eyes and his hands, and the way
the hair grew on brow and nape, and it seemed to
her that thus and not otherwise should a man's
hair and eyes and hands be.</p>

<p>But they did not look at each other so that
their eyes met till the boat rounded the corner to
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wier'">weir</ins>-pool below Stoneham Lock. Then their
eyes met, and they smiled, and she said:</p>

<p>"I am very glad to be here."</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she owed him the admission.
He took it as she would have wished him
to take it.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like my river," he said.</p>

<p>She was very much interested in the opening of
the lock gates and deplored the necessity which
kept her in the boat, hanging on to the edge of the
lock with a boat-hook while he wielded the crowbar.
The locks on the Medway are primitive in
their construction and heavy to work. There are
no winches or wheels or artful mechanical contrivances
of weights and levers and cables. There
are sluices, and from the sluice-gates posts rise,
little iron-bound holes in them, holes in which
the urgent nose of the crowbar exactly fits. The
boatman leans indolently against the tarred,
unshaped tree trunk whose ax-wrought end is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the top of the lock gate; the tree trunk swings
back above the close sweet-clover mat that edges
the lock; the lock gates close&mdash;slow, leisurely,
and dignified. Then the boatman stands on the
narrow plank hung by chains to each lock gate,
and with his crowbar chunks up the sluice, with
a pleasant ringing sound of iron on iron, securing
the raised sluice with a shining iron pin that hangs
by a little chain of its own against the front of the
lock gate, like an ornament for a gentleman's fob.
If you get your hand under the pin and the sluice
happens to sink, you hurt your hand.</p>

<p>Slowly the lock fills with gentle swirls of foam-white
water, slowly the water rises, and the boat
with it, the long gates unclose to let you out&mdash;slow,
leisurely, dignified&mdash;and your boat sweeps out
along the upper tide, smoothly gliding like a boat
in a dream.</p>

<p>Thus the two passed through Stoneham Lock
and the next and the next, and then came to the
Round Lock, which is like a round pond whose
water creeps in among the roots of grass and
forget-me-not and spearmint and wild strawberry.
And so at last to Oak Weir Lock, where the turtledoves
call from the willow wood on the island
where the big trees are, and the wide, sunny meadows
where the sheep browse all day till the shepherd
calls them home in the evening&mdash;the shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with his dog at his heels and his iron crook, polished
with long use and stately as a crozier in a
bishop's hand.</p>

<p>They met no one&mdash;or almost no one. At East
Peckham a single rustic looked at them over the
middle arch of the seven-arched bridge built of
fine, strong stone in the days of the Fourth Edward,
and at Lady White Weir a tramp gave them
good day and said it was a good bit yet to Maidstone.
He spat in the water, not in insolence, but
contemplatively, and Edward gave him a silver
token of good will and a generous pinch of dark
tobacco, with a friendly, "Here's for luck."</p>

<p>"You're a gentleman," the tramp retorted,
grudgingly, and spat again, and slouched off along
the green path. These two were all. Not another
human face did they see for all the length of their
little voyage.</p>

<p>All the long and lovely way it was just these
two and the river and the fields and the flowers
and the blue sky and youth and summer and the
sun.</p>

<p>At Oak Weir they put the boat through the
lock, and under the giant trees they unpacked the
luncheon-basket they had brought from the Midlothian&mdash;how
far away and how incredibly out of
the picture such a place now seemed!&mdash;and sat
among the twisted tree roots, and ate and drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and were merry like children on a holiday. It
was late when they reached the weir, and by the
time the necessity of the return journey urged
itself upon them the shadows were growing longer
and blacker till they stretched almost across the
great meadow. The shepherd had taken the sheep
away, passing the two with a nod reserved, but
not in its essence unfriendly. Edward had smoked
a good many cigarettes, and they had talked a
good deal. It was as he had said at their first
meeting, they were like two travelers who, meeting,
hasten to spread, each before the other, the
relics and spoils of many a long and lonely journey.</p>

<p>"I wish we could have stayed here," she said
at last. "If we had only had the sense to fold our
tents, like the Arabs, and bring them with us, I
suppose we could have camped here."</p>

<p>"It isn't only tents," he said; "it's all the elegancies
of the toilette&mdash;brushes and combs and
slippers. You must return to the <i>Caravansary</i>
that guards these treasures. The nine-fifty-five
will do us. But we haven't much more than time.
There's the boat to pay for and the basket to
get to the station. Come, Princess, if we could
stay here forever we would, but since we can't
we won't stay another minute."</p>

<p>Once in the boat, and in the lock, she leaned
back, holding the edge of the lock with the boat-hook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and with the other hand detaining Charles.
She looked back dreamily on the day which had
been, and she did not pretend that it had not been,
the happiest day in her life. To be with one who
pleased&mdash;he certainly did please&mdash;and to whom
one's every word and look was so obviously pleasing!
It is idle to deny that she felt smoothed,
stroked the right way, like a cat who is fortunate
in its friends. And now all days were to be like
this. The crowbar began its chinking&mdash;once,
twice&mdash;then a jarring sound, and a low but quite
distinct "Damn!"</p>

<p>She started out of her dream.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he was saying, "but I've
caught my finger, like a fool. I can't do anything.
Can you come here?"</p>

<p>"Of course." She stepped out of the boat. The
water in the lock had hardly begun to subside.
She took the painter and, holding it, went to him,
Charles following with cheerful bounds. The
sluice had slipped a little and its iron pin held
his finger firmly clipped against the tarred wood
below.</p>

<p>She did not cry out nor tremble nor do any of the
things a silly woman might have done. "Tell me
what to do," was all she said.</p>

<p>He told her how to hold the crowbar, how to
raise the sluice so that the finger might be released.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
She did it all exactly and carefully.
When the finger was released he wrapped his handkerchief
around it.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" she said.</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"You must put it in the water," she said. "You
can't reach it here. Come into the boat."</p>

<p>He obeyed her. She came and sat by him in
the stern&mdash;sat there quite silently. No "I'm so
sorry!" or "Can't I do anything?" Her hand was
on Charles's collar. His eyes were closed. His
finger was badly crushed; the blood stained the
water, and presently she saw it. She kept her
eyes fixed on the spreading splash of red.</p>

<p>"You haven't fainted, have you?" she said at
last. "It's getting very dark."</p>

<p>"No," he said, and opened his eyes. She raised
hers, and both perceived one reason for the darkness&mdash;the
boat had sunk nine feet or so. The
dark, dripping walls of the lock towered above
them. While he had fought his pain and she her
sympathy the lock had been slowly emptying itself.
They were at the bottom, or almost, and up
those smooth walls there was no climbing out.</p>

<p>"Push the boat against the lower gate," he said;
and as she obeyed he added, "I must try to climb
up somehow. I'll pitch the crowbar up on shore
first. Where is it?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I left it on the lock gate," she said. "Wasn't
that right?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he told her; but even as
he spoke the sluice, which the weight of the water
had held in place after the pin had been removed,
now, as the waters above and below it grew level
with each other, fell into its place with a splash
and an echoing boom, and with the shock the
crowbar fell from its resting-place on the tarred
ledge and disappeared in the water below.</p>

<p>"Lucky it didn't fall on us," he said, and
laughed. "It's no use my climbing out now,
Princess. I couldn't open the gate, anyhow.
We're caught like two poor little rabbits in a trap&mdash;or
three, if you count Charles&mdash;and here we
must stay till some one comes along with a crowbar.
I dare say there'll be a barge by and by.
D'you mind very much?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," she assured him, cheerfully. "It's
all my fault, anyhow, and, besides, I enjoy it.
Let me tie your hand up, and then you must smoke
till rescue comes."</p>

<p>"Aren't you cold?" he asked, for indeed the air
was chill in that watery inclosure.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I have my cloak," she said, and
snuggled into it. "But you'll be cold. Have
half&mdash;it's a student's cloak, eight yards around."</p>

<p>He accepted the offer, and they sat with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
cloak wrapped around them both, with Charles
snuggling under the lower folds of it.</p>

<p>"If you hear a footstep or a whistle or anything,
shout," he said. "I do wish I hadn't let you in
for this. I hate a fool."</p>

<p>"I don't mind a bit, except about your finger.
The bone isn't broken, is it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I've just made a fuss about
nothing. I hate a fool, as I said before."</p>

<p>She thought of the wet patch on the tarred
wood and the red patch in the water, and he felt
her shiver.</p>

<p>"It's very decent of you," said she, "not to
scold me about leaving the crowbar there."</p>

<p>"A good Medway boatman should never be
separated from his crowbar," he said, monitorily.</p>

<p>"I know that now," she said. "I ought to have
known before. I hate a fool, too."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OAK WEIR LOCK</div>


<div class='cap'>"IF it weren't for your finger&mdash;" said she.</div>

<p>"My finger is the just reward of idiocy and
doesn't deserve any kind thought from you."</p>

<p>"If it weren't for that, I should rather enjoy it,"
she said. "There's plenty to eat left in the
basket. Shall I get it out and let's have supper
before it's quite dark? I do really think it's fun.
Don't you?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said he, with a show of bitterness,
"make the best of it out of pity for the insane
idiot who landed you in this fix. Be bright,
be womanly, never let me guess that a cold, damp
lock and a 'few bits of broken vittles' are not really
better than a decent supper and a roof over your
head. A fig for the elegancies of civilization and
the comforts of home! Go on being tactful. I
adore it."</p>

<p>"I meant what I said," she answered, with
gentle insistence. "I do rather like it. I'll whine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
about my dinner and my looking-glass, if you
like, but I'll get the supper first. Isn't it glorious
to think that there's no one at home&mdash;where the
comforts and the elegancies are&mdash;no one to be
anxious about us because we're late, and scold us
when we get home? Liberty," she ended, reflectively,
"is a very beautiful thing. I suppose no
one is likely to come along this way till the shepherd
comes in the morning?"</p>

<p>"We'll hope for better luck," said he. "I say,
you'll never trust me to take care of you again
after this silly business&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, deliberately, "that I
ever asked you to take care of me. Did I? You
were to help me&mdash;yes, and you have helped me&mdash;but
I don't think I want to be taken care of, any
more than another man would want it. I was in
a difficulty and you helped me. If you were in a
difficulty and I helped you, you wouldn't expect
me to take care of you forever, would you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "If you hadn't been
extraordinarily sensible I should still be there with
my hand in the thumbscrew."</p>

<p>"Did you think," she asked, sweetly, "that all
women were inevitably silly?"</p>

<p>Charles raised his head and growled.</p>

<p>"There," said she, "you see, even Charles repudiates
the idea."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>If this was so, Charles instantly repudiated the
idea with more growls and the added violence of
barks. She muffled him in the cloak and listened.
A footstep on the towing-path.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" she called, and Edward added, "Hi,
you there!" and Charles, wriggling forcefully
among the folds of the cloak, barked again.</p>

<p>"That ought to fetch them, whoever they are,"
said Edward, and stood up.</p>

<p>Even as he did so a voice said, urgently and
quite close above them. "'Ush, can't yer!" and
a head and shoulders leaning over the edge of the
lock came as a dark silhouette against the clear
dark blue of the starry sky. For it was now as
dark as a July night is&mdash;and that, as we know, is
never really dark at all. '"Ush!" repeated the
voice. "Shut up, I tell yer!" and, surprisingly
and unmistakably, it was to the two in the boat
that he was speaking. "Make that dawg o' yours
choke hisself&mdash;stow it, can't yer! Yer don't want
to be lagged, do yer? Yer aren't got 'arf a chants
once any one knows you're 'ere. Don't you know
you're wanted? The police'll be along some time
in the night, and then you're done for."</p>

<p>"I think," said Edward, with extreme politeness,
"that you are, perhaps, mistaking us for acquaintances,
whereas we are strangers to you.
But if you could be so kind as to open the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and lend us a crowbar to get through the other
locks you would not be the loser."</p>

<p>"I know yer, right enough," said the man.
"Yer ain't no strangers to me. It was me as
'ired yer the boat up at the Anchor. The boss
'e sent me out to look for yer. Only 'e doesn't
know I know about your being wanted. Least
said soonest mended's what I allus say. Where's
yer crow got to?"</p>

<p>"In the water," said Edward; "dropped off the
lock gate."</p>

<p>"Clumsy!" said the man, giving the word its
full vocative value. "Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Just over there," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Then yer tuck up yer shirt-sleeve and run yer
'and down and pass that there crow up to me.
There ain't not above two foot o' water in 'er, if
there's that."</p>

<p>To your Medway man the lock is as unalterably
feminine as his ship to a sailor.</p>

<p>It was she who plunged her arm in the water,
and, sure enough, there was the crowbar lying
quietly and tamely beside them&mdash;"like a pet
poodle," as she said.</p>

<p>"Give me ahold of that there crow," said the
man. He lay face downward and reached down
an arm. Edward stood on the thwart and
reached up. The crowbar changed hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the head and shoulders of the deliverer disappeared.</p>

<p>"I don't see what he wants the bar for," said
Edward. "The lock's empty. Perhaps he means
to go on ahead and open the other locks for us.
I wonder who he took us for, and what the poor
wretches are 'wanted' for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a sinister word in that connection, isn't
it?" said she. "Wanted!"</p>

<p>They pushed the boat toward the lower lock
gate and held on to the lock-side, waiting till the
lock gate should open and they should be able to
pass out and begin their journey down the river
to the Anchor. But the gates did not open, and
almost at once a tremor agitated the boat. Edward
tightened his grip of the boat-hook as the incoming
rush of water took the boat's nose and held
it hard.</p>

<p>"The idiot!" he said. "The silly idiot! He's
filling the lock."</p>

<p>He was, and the rush of the incoming water
quite drowned any remonstrances that might have
been addressed to him. Boat and water rose
swiftly, the upper gates opened, and, as they
passed through, their deliverer laid his hand on
the gunwale, as though to aid the boat's passage.
But, instead, he stopped it.</p>

<p>"See 'ere, gov'ner," he said, low and hoarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and exactly like a conspirator, "I couldn't bleat
it out for all the country to hear while yer was
down in the lock, but I knows as you're wanted
and yer may think it lucky it's me as come after
yer and not the gov'ner nor yet the police."</p>

<p>"I do really think," said she, softly, "that
you're making a mistake. The police don't
really want us."</p>

<p>"Oh, I got a bit of candle," was the unexpected
rejoinder. "Get the young lady to hold the cloak
up so as it don't shine from 'ere to Tunbridge to
give yer away like, and yer light the dip and 'ave
a squint at this 'ere."</p>

<p>He held out the candle and matches and a
jagged rag of newspaper.</p>

<p>"'Ere," he said, "'longside where I'm 'olding
of it."</p>

<p>She made a sort of screen of the cloak. Edward
lit the candle, and when the flame had darkened
and brightened again he read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p><span class="smcap">Missing</span>&mdash;Young lady, height five feet six, slight build, dark
hair and eyes, pale complexion. Last seen at Jevington, Sussex.
Wearing black chiffon and satin dress, black satin slippers,
and a very large French circular cloak with stitched
collar. Has no money and no hat. Twenty pounds will be
paid to any one giving information as to her whereabouts.</p></div>

<p>"Well," said Edward, blowing out the candle,
"this lady has a hat, as you see, and she hasn't a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
black dress and satin slippers. Thank you for
letting us through; here's something to get a
drink with. Hand over the crowbar, please, and
good night to you."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, sir," said the man, still holding
on, "and don't make to jab me over the fingers
with the boat-'ook, like what you was thinking
of. I'm your friend, I am. I see that piece in
the paper 'fore ever a one of them, but I never
let on. That's why the gov'ner sent me, 'cause
why&mdash;'e didn't think I knowed, and 'e means to
'ave that twenty pounds hisself."</p>

<p>"But," said she, "you see, I have got a hat and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," said the man, "an' you've got the
cloak, large and black and stitched collar, and
all; it's that what's give yer away."</p>

<p>"But supposing I <em>was</em> the young lady," she said,
grasping Edward's arm in the darkness, and signaling
to him not to interfere with feminine
diplomacy, "you wouldn't give me up to the police,
would you? I wouldn't give you up if the
police wanted you."</p>

<p>"'Course I wouldn't," he answered, earnestly.
"Ain't that what I'm a-saying? I'm 'ere to 'elp
yer do a bolt. The minute I saw that there bit
in the paper I says to myself, 'It's them,' and
why shouldn't I 'ave the twenty pounds as well
as any one else?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"There," said Edward, in a low voice, "you see!
Let me deal with him."</p>

<p>But again her hand implored. "You're going
to give us up to the police for twenty pounds?"
she said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>He groaned. "'Ow yer do talk!" he said.
"Women is all alike when it comes to talking.
Stop talking and listen to me. Can't yer understand
plain words? What yer got to do is to
leave the boat at Mutton Worry Lock&mdash;that's
three locks up&mdash;bunk across the fields to Tunbridge.
If yer got money enough&mdash;and I'm sartain
yer 'as, by the looks of yer&mdash;yer 'ire one of
them motors and get away as fast as yer can.
Get one at the Castle. Say yer going to Brighton,
and when yer get away from the town tell the
chap to drive t'other way."</p>

<p>"That's a good plan," said she.</p>

<p>"I mapped it all out as I come along," he said,
with simple pride. "And, mind yer, I'm trusting
yer like I shouldn't have thought I'd 'a' trusted
nobody. 'Ave yer got the twenty pounds about
yer?" he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," said she.</p>

<p>"Can't be helped, then." He breathed a sigh of
resignation. "I'll just give yer my direction and
yer send the ready to me. 'Oo says I don't trust
yer?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean," said Edward, slowly, and would
not be checked any longer by that hand on his
arm&mdash;"you mean that you expect us to give you
twenty pounds not to give us up to the police?
The police have nothing to do with us. The whole
thing's moonshine. Take your hand off the boat
and get along home."</p>

<p>"Any man," said he who had been called Neptune&mdash;"any
man as had the feelings of a man
would think of this&mdash;young lady. Even if yer
was to prove to Poad as yer wasn't wanted for
nothin' criminal&mdash;it's none so easy to make Poad
see anything, neither"&mdash;he ended, abruptly, and
began anew. "Look 'ere, gov'ner, on account of
your lady I say do a bolt. An' why should I be
the loser? I only got to stick to the boat, whichever
way yer go&mdash;up and down&mdash;and soon as yer
land where there's a copper, lagged yer'll be to a
dead cart, and only yourself to thank for it.
Whereas I'm only trying to be your friend, if
you'd only see it."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should be so friendly,"
said Edward, now entirely losing control of the
situation.</p>

<p>"Nor I shouldn't see it, neither, if it was only
you," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"He's quite right," she whispered. "Promise
what he wants and let's get away. I know exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
what Poad is like. We should never make him
understand anything. I couldn't bear it. Let's
go. If you've got twenty pounds, give it to him
and let's go."</p>

<p>"Think of your young lady," repeated the voice
out of the darkness. "If yer promise to let me
'ear by the post, I'll take your word for it. I'm
your true friend, and I knows a gentleman when I
sees one."</p>

<p>"If you were a true friend," said Edward, "you
wouldn't want paying for minding your own business."</p>

<p>"Aw, naw," he said, "'old 'ard, gov'ner. Ain't
it a man's own business when there's twenty
pounds to be made? Says I to myself, if it's
worth some one's while to pay the money to catch
'er, it's well worth the gentleman's while to shell
out and keep 'er, and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Oh, hold your tongue!" said Edward. "Go
on ahead and get the next lock ready. I'll give
you the money. The lady wishes it."</p>

<p>"She's got her 'ead the right way on," said the
friend in need. "Pull ahead, sir."</p>

<p>"But you can't, with your finger like that," she
said. "I'll pull."</p>

<p>"Why not let me?" Neptune suggested. "We'd
get there in 'alf the time," he added, with blighting
candor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>So Neptune pulled the boat up to Mutton
Worry Lock and the two crouched under the
cloak. Charles, who might have been expected
to be hostile to so strange a friend, received him
with almost overwhelming condescension. At
Mutton Worry Lock the deliverer said:</p>

<p>"Now 'ere yer deserts the ship, and 'ere I finds
'er and takes her back. And look 'ere, sir, I'm
nobody's enemy but my own, so I am. And of
course if I was to 'ave the twenty pounds it's my
belief I'd drink myself under the daisies inside
of a week. Let me 'ear by the post&mdash;William
Beale, care of the Anchor Hotel&mdash;and send me
ten bob a week till the money's gone. It'll come
easier to yer, paying it a little at a time like&mdash;and
better for me in the long run. Yer ought to be a
duke, yer ought. I never thought you'd 'a' ris' to
the twenty. I'd 'a' been satisfied with five&mdash;and
that'll show yer whether I'm a true friend or
not."</p>

<p>"I really think you are," she said, and laughed
gently. "Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good evening, miss, and thank yer, I'm sure.
Never say good-by; it's unlucky between friends."</p>

<p>"Here's a sovereign," said Edward, shortly.
"Good night. You're jolly fond of the sound of
your own voice, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Sort of treat for me, sir," said Beale, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
eagerly explanatory. "Don't often 'ear it.
D'you know what they calls me at the Anchor,
owing to me 'aving learnt to keep my tongue
atween my teeth, except among friends? 'William
the Silent's' my pet name. A gent as comes for
the angling made that up, and it stuck, it did.
Bear to the left till you come to the boat-'ouse,
cater across the big meadow, and you'll hit Tunbridge
all right, by the Printing Works. So long,
sir; so long, miss."</p>

<p>Thus they parted.</p>

<p>"What an adventure!" she said; "and I believe
William the Silent believes himself to be a model
of chivalrous moderation. He would have been
satisfied with five pounds."</p>

<p>"I believe he would, too," said Edward, with a
grudging laugh. "It's your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux yeux</i>. The man
has gone home feeling that he has as good as
sacrificed fifteen pounds to a quixotic and romantic
impulse. Wretched blackmailer though
he is, he could not resist a princess."</p>

<p>"I like William," she said, decisively. "After
all, as he says, one must live. Let's leave the cloak
under this hedge. Shall we? It's like getting rid of
the body. And I'll buy a flaxen wig to-morrow.
And do you think it would be a help if I rouged
a little and wore blue spectacles? It will be the
saving of us, of course."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope to heavens we get a motor in Tunbridge,"
said he. "You must be tired out."</p>

<p>"I'm not in the least tired," she said. "I'm
stepping out like a man, don't you think? I've
enjoyed everything beyond words. What a world
it is for adventures once you step outside the
charmed circle of your relations. Look at all the
things that have happened to us already!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean anything to happen except
pleasant things," said he.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, with a fleeting seriousness,
"life isn't like that. But there's been nothing but
pleasant things so far&mdash;at least, almost nothing."</p>

<p>"Won't you take my arm?" he said.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To help you along, I suppose," he said, lamely.</p>

<p>She stopped expressly to stamp her foot. "I
don't want helping along," she said. "I'm not a
cripple or a baby&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not answer. And they walked on in
silence through the starry, silent night. She spoke
first.</p>

<p>"I don't want helping along," she said. "But
I'd like to take your arm to show there's no ill-feeling.
You take an arm on the way to dinner,"
she assured the stars, "and why not on the way
to Tunbridge?"</p>

<p>The way to Tunbridge was short. They found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a car, and the night held no more adventures for
them.</p>

<p>But in a sheltered nook in the weir stream below
Jezebel's Lock a candle set up on a plate illuminated
the green of alder and ash and the smooth
blackness of the water, shedding on a lonely supper
that air as of a festival which can only be
conferred by candle-light shining on the green of
growing leaves. There, out of sight of the towing-path,
Mr. William Beale, charmed to fancy and
anticipation by the possession of a golden milled
token, made himself a feast of the "broken vittles"
in the derelict Midlothian basket, and in what was
left of the red wine of France toasted the lady of
his adventure.</p>

<p>"'Ere's to 'er," he said to the silence and mysteries
of wood and water. '"Ere's to 'er. She
was a corker, for sure. Sight too good for a
chap like 'im," he insisted, adding the natural
tribute of chivalry to beauty; drank again and
filled his pipe. Edward, from sheer force of habit,
had smoothed the parting with tobacco.</p>

<p>"Not but," said William the Silent&mdash;"not but
what I've known worse than 'im, by long chalks.
Ten bob a week&mdash;and 'e'll send it along, too&mdash;good
as a pension. 'E'll send it along."</p>

<p>He did. William the Silent had not misjudged
his man.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GUILDHALL</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHERE is Charles?" she asked next day.</div>

<p>Edward had called for her early, had
paid the Midlothian's bill and tipped the Midlothian's
servants, and now they were in a taxi
on their way to Paddington. She had definitely
put her finger on the map that morning, and its
tip had covered the K's of Kenilworth and Warwick.
She was still almost breathless with the
hurry with which she had been swept away from
the safe anchorage of the hotel, "and couldn't we
have the hood down?" she added.</p>

<p>"Charles," said Edward, "is at present boarded
out at a mews down Portland Road way, and I
think we'd better keep the hood up. Look here!
I never thought of the newspapers. This is worse
than ever."</p>

<p>He handed her the <cite>Telegraph</cite>. Yesterday's advertisement
was repeated in it&mdash;with this addition:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>May be in company with tall, fair young man. Blue eyes,
military appearance. Possesses large, white bull-terrier.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear! They'll track us down," she said,
and laughed. "What sleuth-hounds they are!
But they can't do anything to me, can they?
They can't take me back, I mean. I'm twenty-one,
you know. Can't you do as you like when
you're twenty-one?"</p>

<p>She looked at the paper again, and now her face
suddenly became clouded and her eyes filled with
tears. "I never thought of that." She hesitated
a moment and handed him the paper, pointing to
the place with the finger that had found Warwick
and Kenilworth. Below the advertisement touching
the young man and the bull-terrier, he read:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p><span class="smcap">Silver Locks</span>&mdash;Come back. I am ill and very anxious.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Aunt Alice.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"That means.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?"</p>

<p>"It means me. I'm Silver Locks&mdash;it's her pet
name for me. I called my aunts the three bears
once, when I was little, in fun, you know. And
the others were angry&mdash;but <em>she</em> laughed and called
me Silver Locks. And she's called it me ever
since. I never thought about her worrying. What
am I to do? I must go back. I thought it was
too good to last, yesterday," she added, bitterly.</p>

<p>He put the admission away in a safe place,
whence later he could take it out and caress it,
and said, "Of course you must go back if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to. But don't do it without thinking. We meant
to talk over our plans yesterday, but somehow we
didn't. Let's do it to-day."</p>

<p>"But I can't go to Warwick. I must go back
to her&mdash;I must."</p>

<p>"If you do," he said, "you won't go back to
just her&mdash;you'll go back to the whole miserable
muddle you've got away from. You'll go back to
your other aunts and to your father. Besides,
how do you know who put that advertisement
in? Think carefully. Is the advertisement like
her?"</p>

<p>"It's like her to be anxious and kind," said she.</p>

<p>"I mean, is she the sort of woman to advertise
that she's ill? To advertise your pet name&mdash;and
her own name&mdash;so that every one who knows you
both and sees the advertisement will know that
you are being advertised for? Is that like her?"
He ended, astonished at his own penetration.</p>

<p>"No," she said, slowly, "it isn't. And it isn't
like her to say she's ill. She never complains."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't use her illness as a lever to move
events to her liking?"</p>

<p>"Never!" she said, almost indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then I think that this advertisement is some
one else's. Where does she live."</p>

<p>"Hyde Park Square."</p>

<p>"Let us telegraph her, and not go to Warwick."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>They stopped the taxi and composed a message.
He despatched it.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>Did you put advertisement in paper to-day? And are you
ill? I am quite well and will write at once. Wire reply to
Silver Locks, General Post-Office.</p></div>

<p>Then they told the man to drive around Regent's
Park, to pass the time till there should be
an answer.</p>

<p>In the park the trees were already brown, and
on the pale, trampled grass long heaps of rags,
like black grave-mounds, showed where weary
men who had tramped London all night, moved
on by Law and Order, inexorable in blue and
silver, now at last had their sleep out, in broad
sunshine, under the eyes of the richest city in the
world. Little children, dirty and poor&mdash;their
childhood triumphant over dirt and poverty&mdash;played
happily in the grass that was less grass
than dust.</p>

<p>"What a horrible place London is!" she said.
"Think of yesterday."</p>

<p>That, too, he put away to be taken out and
loved later.</p>

<p>"We won't stay in London," he said, "if the
answer is what I think it will be. We'll go out into
the green country and decide what we're going to
do."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if she <em>did</em> put the advertisement in, it
means that she's <em>very</em> ill. And then I must go to
her."</p>

<p>"But if she didn't&mdash;and I more and more
think she didn't&mdash;they may send some one to the
General Post-Office post-haste&mdash;so it won't do for
you to go for the telegram. Do you know the
Guildhall Library?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful place&mdash;very quiet, very calm.
And the officials are the best chaps I've ever found
in any library anywhere. We'll go there. You
must want to look up something. Let's see&mdash;the
dates of the publication of Bacon's works. Write
your name in the book&mdash;any name you like, so
long as it isn't your own; then ask one of the
officials to help you, and go and sit at one of the
side tables&mdash;they're like side chapels in a cathedral&mdash;and
stay there till I come. You'll be as
safe and as secret as if you were in the Bastille.
And I'll baffle pursuit and come to you as soon as
I can."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, meekly.</p>

<p>"And don't worry," he urged. "The more I
think of it, the more certain I am that it was not
the aunt you like who wrote that advertisement&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was right. The telegram with which, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hour later, he presented himself at the Guildhall
Library ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>I did not write advertisement and I am not specially ill,
but I am very anxious. Write at once. Aunt Loo and
Aunt Enid are both here. I think they must have inserted
the advertisement. A.</p></div>

<p>"Your Aunt Alice is a sportsman," he said, "to
warn you like that."</p>

<p>"I told you she was a darling," she answered&mdash;and
her whole face had lighted up with relief&mdash;"and
you are the cleverest person in the world!
I should never have thought about its not being
her doing, never in a thousand years. You deserve
a medal and a statue and a pension."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve more than I've got," said he,
"nor half so much. The sun shines again."</p>

<p>She flashed a brilliant smile at him, and pushed
a brown book along the table.</p>

<p>"I suppose we ought to look studious," she said,
"or they'll turn us out. I am so glad Aunt Alice
isn't really worse. You don't know how I've felt
while you've been away. It seemed so horribly
selfish&mdash;to have been so happy and all while she
was ill and worried. But, of course, you do
know."</p>

<p>"Let us go out," he said, putting the books
together.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I know all about Bacon.
Not that I'll ever want to know."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," said he. "Did it ever occur
to you that perhaps the Baconians are right, and
he was an intellectual giant, almost like Plato and
Aristotle rolled into one? We'll go to Stratford
some day, and look at Shakespeare's bust and see
if we think he could have written 'The Tempest.'"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't judge people by their faces,"
she said. "Handsome is as handsome does."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you should," said he. "It's handsome
does as handsome is. I always go by appearances.
Don't you? But of course, I know you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>She opened one of the books and began to turn
the pages. "Look what I found," she said, and
all the time their voices had been lowered to the
key of that studious place. "Look, isn't it pretty?
And do you see?&mdash;the e's are like the Greek &#952;. Can
you read it?"</p>

<p>He read:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Fair Lucrece, kind Catherine, gentle Jane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But Maria is the dearest name.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Robert Swinford, 1863."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Yes, that's what I make it. It doesn't rhyme,
but I expect Maria was very pleased. Do you
think they were studying with a stern tutor, and
he wrote that and pushed it over to her when no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one was looking? It's an odd thing to have
written in a Natural History book. There's something
more on another page&mdash;but it doesn't make
sense:</p>

<div class='center'>
"I am true rew Hebrew&mdash;CXIX&mdash;101."<br />
</div>

<p>"I expect he was just trying a pen. Come, the
librarian has his scholarly eye on you."</p>

<p>"I should like to look through all the old books
and find out all the names people have written and
make stories about them," she said, and he received
the curious impression that she was talking
against time; there was about her a sort of
hanging back from the needful movement of departure.
He picked the books up and carried
them to the counter, she following, and they
walked in silence down the gallery hung with
Wouvermans and his everlasting gray horse.</p>

<p>"Let's go into the Hall," he said. So they
turned under the arch and went into the beautiful
great vaulted Guildhall, where the giants Gog and
Magog occupy the gallery, and little human people
can sit below on stone benches against the wall,
and gaze on the monuments of the elder and the
younger Pitt, and talk at long leisure, undisturbed
and undisturbing, which is not the case in
the Library, as Edward pointed out.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he began.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, hurriedly. "Something will
have to be done about Aunt Alice."</p>

<p>"Yes. But what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She turned and leaned one
hand on the stone seat so that she faced him.
"You do believe that I don't regret coming away?
I think it would have been splendid to have gone
on&mdash;like yesterday&mdash;but you see it's impossible."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he said, stoutly.</p>

<p>She made a movement of impatience. "Oh yes,
it is&mdash;quite," she said. "However rich you are,
you can't go on forever being blackmailed. Every
one would know us, or else you'd have to
give up Charles, and even then I expect you'd be
obliged to pay twenty pounds every three-quarters
of an hour. It can't be done. And, besides, we
should never know a moment's peace. Wherever
we went we should imagine a blackmailer behind
every bush, and every one we spoke to might be
a detective. It's no use. I must go back. Do
say you know I must."</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, say you know I don't want to."</p>

<p>"I can't say that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because, if you don't
want to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there's always the old alternative,
you know." He was looking straight before him
at the majestic form of the Earl of Chatham.</p>

<p>"What alternative?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marrying me," he said, humbly. "Do. I
don't believe that you'd regret it."</p>

<p>"When I marry," she said, strongly, "it won't
be just because I want to get myself out of a
scrape."</p>

<p>"I hoped there might be other considerations,"
he said, still gazing at the marble. "You were
happy yesterday. You said so."</p>

<p>"You talk as though marrying were just nothing&mdash;like
choosing a partner for a dance. It's
like&mdash;like choosing what patterns you'd be tattooed
with, if you were a savage. It's for life."</p>

<p>"And you can't like me well enough to choose
me?"</p>

<p>"I do like you," she answered, with swift and
most disheartening eagerness, "I do like you
awfully; better than any man I've ever known&mdash;oh,
miles better&mdash;not that that's saying much.
But I don't know you well enough to marry
you."</p>

<p>"You don't think it would turn out well?"</p>

<p>She faltered a little. "It&mdash;it mightn't."</p>

<p>"We could go on being friends just as we are
now," he urged.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be the same," she said, "because
there'd be no way out. If we found we didn't like
each other, to-morrow, or next month, or on
Tuesday week, we could just say good-by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
there'd be no harm done. But if we were married&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Do you feel as though you would dislike me
by Tuesday week?"</p>

<p>"You know I don't," she said, impatiently,
"but I might. Or you might. One never knows.
It isn't safe. It isn't wise. I may be silly, but
I'm not silly enough to marry for any reason but
one."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"That I couldn't bear to part with him, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"And you can bear to part with me. There
hasn't been much, has there? Just these three
days, and all our talks, and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." He stopped.
A tear had fallen on her lap. "I won't worry
any more," he said, in an altered voice. "You
shall do just what you like. Shall I get a taxi
and take you straight to your aunt's? I will if
you like. Come."</p>

<p>"There's no such hurry as all that," she said,
"and it's no use being angry with me because I
won't jump over a wall without knowing what's
on the other side. No, why I should jump, either,"
she added, on the impulse of a sudden thought.
"You haven't told me that yet. What good would
my getting married do to Aunt Alice? I don't
mean that I would, because you know I couldn't&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
for her&mdash;but what good would it do if I
did?"</p>

<p>"If we were married," he said, with a careful
absence of emotion, "we could send your aunt a
copy of our marriage certificate and a reference
to my solicitor. She would then know that you
had married a respectable person with an assured
income, instead of which you now appear to be
running about the country stealing ducks with
Heaven knows who."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I see that. Oh, I have a
glorious idea! It will suit you and me and Aunt
Alice and make everybody happy!&mdash;like in books.
Let's have a mock marriage, and forge the certificate."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a marriage certificate?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Well, it would be as difficult to forge as a
bank-note."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;have you ever seen one?" she asked,
and he hoped it was anxiety he read in her tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know a chap who's a registrar. I've
witnessed a marriage before now."</p>

<p>"Then there's no need to forge," she said, light-heartedly.
"Your friend would give you one of
the certificates, of course, if you asked him, and
we could fill it in and make Aunt Alice happy."</p>

<p>He laughed, and the sound, echoing in the gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
emptiness of the Hall, drew on him the sour glance
of a barrister, wigged and gowned, hastening to
the mayor's court.</p>

<p>"He's wondering what you've got to laugh at,"
she said, "and I don't wonder. <em>I</em> don't know.
Why shouldn't we pretend to be married? I'm
sure your friend would help us to. Oh, do!" she
said, clasping her hands with an exaggerated gesture
that could not quite hide the genuine appeal
behind it. "Then we sha'n't have to part. I mean
I sha'n't have to go back to the aunts and all
the worry that I thought I'd got away from."</p>

<p>"You're not really serious."</p>

<p>"But I am. You will&mdash;oh, do say you will."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it's impossible&mdash;Princess, don't
ask if I can't."</p>

<p>"Then it's all over?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, if you insist on going back."</p>

<p>"I don't insist. But I must do something about
Aunt Alice. She's always been a darling to me.
I can't go away and be happy and not care whether
she's miserable or not. You'd hate me if I could.
I'll go back to-morrow or to-night. You said we
should go into the country and think things out.
At least we can do that&mdash;we can have one more
day. Shall we?"</p>

<p>Her sweet eyes tempted and implored.</p>

<p>"What sort of day would it be," he said, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the end of everything at the end of it? How could
we be happy as we were yesterday?&mdash;for you were
happy, you owned it. How could we be happy
together when we knew we'd got to part in six
hours&mdash;five hours&mdash;two hours&mdash;half an hour? Besides,
why should I give you the chance to grow
any dearer? So as to make it hurt more when
you took yourself away from me? No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was dear," she said, in a very
small voice.</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not hear it, for he went on:
"If the splendid adventure is to end like this, let
it end here&mdash;now. I've had the two days; you
can't take those from me."</p>

<p>"I don't want to take anything from you,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's make an end of it, then," he said, ruthlessly,
"since that's what you choose. Good-by,
Princess. Let's shake hands and part friends."
He rose. "Let's part friends," he repeated, and
paused, remembering that you cannot go away
and leave a lady planted in the Guildhall. Yet
he could not say, "Let us part friends, and now
I will call a cab."</p>

<p>She was more expert. "At least," she put it,
"we needn't part here in the dark among the
images of dead people. Come out into the sunshine
and look at the pretty pigeons."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He was grateful to her. In the Guildhall yard
the cab would happen, if it happened at all, naturally
and without any effect of bathos.</p>

<p>They stood watching the sleek birds strutting
on little red feet, and fluttering gray wings in the
sunshine. She thought of the wood-pigeon in the
wood by the river, and the calm brightness of yesterday
held out beckoning hands to her.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was going to end like this,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Nor I," he answered, inexorably.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure it's impossible? The mock
marriage, I mean? In books it's always so frightfully
easy, even when the girl isn't helping?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's impossible," said he. "I wish
it wasn't. Look at that blue chap," he added, indicating
a fat pigeon for the benefit of a passing
boy. "You must go back to your aunts. And
I must go back to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, well, there's nothing
much for me to go back to."</p>

<p>They were walking along King Street now.
"It does seem rather as though a sponge were
going to pass over the slate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there
wouldn't be much left," she said.</p>

<p>He glanced at her, suddenly alert. If she felt
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why, then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He wished that the scene had not been in one
of the most frequented streets of the City of London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
If it had been in a drawing-room, for instance&mdash;her
drawing-room&mdash;it would have been
possible to say the words of parting with something
of dignity and finality. But here, with&mdash;in
the background and not to be evaded&mdash;that snorting
taxicab over whose closed door their farewells
must be made.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But need it be across a
taxicab door?</p>

<p>"Let us," he said, "take a cab. I will go with
you as far as Hyde Park Square."</p>

<p>"Shall we have the hood down?" she asked,
with intention. "It doesn't matter now if any one
does see us." But he pretended not to hear, and
the hood remained as it was.</p>

<p>They were silent all the crowded way along
Cheapside, where there were blocks, as usual, and
the drivers of lorries and wagons were cheerfully
profane. Silent, too, along Newgate Street and
New Oxford Street. The driver, being a wise man,
turned up Bloomsbury Street to escape from the
blocks in Oxford Street; they passed the British
Museum and, presently, the Midlothian Hotel.
And as they passed it, each thought of the breakfast
there only that morning, when she had poured
the coffee of one from whom she had then had
no mind to part.</p>

<p>"Oh, why are we doing it?" She spoke suddenly,
and her speech had the effect of a cry. "We didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mean to say good-by, and now we're going to.
Don't let's."</p>

<p>"But your aunt," he said, feeling as foolish as
any young man need wish. "If you don't go back
to her now you'll want to to-morrow&mdash;and I
can't.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I told you why I want to part now,
if we are to part. Now, before it gets any worse."</p>

<p>"We shall be at Hyde Park Square in a minute,"
she said, desperately.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's nearly over. What number
is it? I must tell the man."</p>

<p>"Tell him to turn around and go somewhere
else&mdash;into the country; we said we would, you
know. I'm not going back to Hyde Park Square.
Tell him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Princess," he said, "I can't bear it. Let him
go on."</p>

<p>"But I'm not asking you to bear anything.
Don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"Not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will; if you'll ask me."</p>

<p>"You'll marry me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "rather than have everything
end in absolute silliness, like this."</p>

<p>He looked at her, at her clasped hands and the
frown of her great resolve. He perceived that he
was worth something to her&mdash;that she was prepared
to pay a price&mdash;the price he set&mdash;rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
lose him altogether. Her eyes met his with a
mingling of courage and desperation, as of one who
has chosen a difficult and dangerous path, one
who makes a great sacrifice, leads a forlorn hope.
And his eyes dwelt for a moment on hers, appreciatively,
thoughtfully. And in that moment his
resolve was taken.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you didn't want to jump the
wall without knowing what it would be like on
the other side. I won't have an unwilling wife.
On the other hand, I won't lose you now, Princess,
for a thousand fathers and ten thousand aunts.
Make up your mind to the mock marriage, and
that shall be the way out."</p>

<p>"But I thought you said it was impossible."</p>

<p>"So it was. But it isn't now. I've been thinking."</p>

<p>She leaned back, turned toward him from the
corner, and faced him with fearless eyes.</p>

<p>"What a nightmare of a day it's been," she
said. "Aren't you glad we're awake again? When
can I send the certificate?" she asked, eager and
alert.</p>

<p>"At the earliest possible moment," said he. "I
must see my friend about it at once. Would you
mind waiting for me&mdash;say in St. Paul's? And then
we'll end our day in the country, after all."</p>

<p>"You are good," she said, and laid her hand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a fleeting instant on his arm. "I do think it's
good of you to give way about the mock marriage.
You know I had really set my heart on it. Now
everything will be plain sailing, won't it? And
we'll go to Warwick the minute we're mock-married,
because my putting my finger on it and
Kenilworth ought to count, oughtn't it?"</p>

<p>"It shall," he said, gravely.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WESTMINSTER</div>


<div class='cap'>A WEDDING-DAY&mdash;even a real wedding-day&mdash;leaves
at best but a vague and incoherent
memory. To the bridegroom it is a confused
whirling recollection of white satin and tears and
smiles and flowers and music&mdash;or perhaps a
dingy room with a long table and an uninterested
registrar at the end of it.</div>

<p>Edward Basingstoke thought with regret of the
flowers and the white satin. If he had accepted
her submission, had consented to the real marriage,
there should have been white roses by the
hundred, and the softest lace and silk to set off
her beauty. As it was&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall have to go through some sort of
form," he told her, "because of the clerks. If my
friend were just to tear out a certificate and give
it to us the people in the office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You understand."</p>

<p>"Quite," she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"It'll be rather like a very dingy pretense at a
marriage. You won't mind that?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Then, if you're sure you really want to go
through with it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall we go to my friend's
now, and get it over?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't mind?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"He must be a very accommodating friend."</p>

<p>"He is," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave the luggage?" she asked,
suddenly. They were walking along the Embankment.</p>

<p>"At Charing Cross."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to get it. And I shall go to
the Charing Cross Hotel with it, and you can
meet me in three hours."</p>

<p>"But that'll only just give us time," he said.
"Why not come with me now?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, firmly, "I won't play at
mock marriages unless I like, and I won't play at
all unless you let me do as I like first."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I meet you again."</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked. And she stopped at the
statue of Forster in the Embankment Gardens,
and answered:</p>

<p>"Here."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she smiled at him so kindly that he asked
no more questions, but just said:</p>

<p>"In three hours, then," and they walked on together
to Charing Cross.</p>

<p>And after three hours, in which he had time to
be at least six different Edwards, he met, by the
statue of the estimable Mr. Forster, a lady all in
fine white linen, wearing a white hat with a wreath
of white roses around it, and long white gloves,
and little white shoes. And she had a white lace
scarf and a live white rose at her waist.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd better dress the part," she said,
a little nervously, "for the sake of the clerks, you
know."</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are," he said, becoming yet
another kind of Edward at the sight of her, and
looking at her as she stood in the afternoon sunshine.
"Why didn't you tell me before how beautiful
you were?"</p>

<p>"I.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How silly you are," was all she found
to say.</p>

<p>"I wish, though," he said, as they walked together
along the gravel of the garden, "that you'd
done it for me, and not for those clerks, confound
them!"</p>

<p>"I didn't really do it for them," she said.
"Oh no&mdash;and not for you, either. I did it
for myself. I couldn't even pretend to be married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in anything but white. It would be so unlucky."</p>

<p>All that he remembered well. And what came
afterward&mdash;the dingy house with the grimy door-step,
and the area where dust and torn paper lay,
the bare room, the few words that were a mockery
of what a marriage service should be, the policeman
who met them as they went in, the charwoman
who followed them as they went out, the man at
the end of the long, leather-covered table&mdash;Edward's
old acquaintance, but that seemed negligible&mdash;who
who wished them joy with, as it were,
his tongue in his cheek. And there was signing
of names and dabbing of them with a little oblong
of pink blotting-paper crisscrossed with the ghosts
of the names of other brides and bridegrooms&mdash;real
ones, these&mdash;and then they were walking down
the sordid street, she rather pale and looking
straight before her, and in her white-gloved hand
the prize of the expedition, the marriage certificate,
to gain which the mock marriage had been
undertaken.</p>

<p>And suddenly the romantic exaltation of the
day yielded to deepest depression, and Edward
Basingstoke, earnestly and from the heart, wished
the day's work undone. It was all very well to
talk about mock marriages, but he knew well
enough that his honor was as deeply engaged as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
though he had been well and truly married in
Westminster Abbey by His Grace of York assisted
by His Grace of Canterbury. Freedom was
over, independence was over, and all his life lay
at the mercy of a girl&mdash;the girl who, a week ago,
had no existence for him. The whole adventure,
from his first sight of her among dewy grass and
trees, had been like a fairy-tale, like a romance of
old chivalry. He had played his part handsomely,
but with the underlying consciousness that it was
a part&mdash;a part sympathetic to his inclinations, but
a part, none the less. The whole thing had been
veiled in the mists of poetry, illuminated by the
glow of adventure. And now it seemed as though
he had thoughtlessly plucked the flower of romance
which, with patience and careful tending,
would have turned to the fruit of happiness. He
had plucked the flower, and all he had gained was
the power to keep a beautiful stranger with him&mdash;on
false pretenses. He wished that she, at least,
had not so gaily entered on the path of deception.
Never a scruple had disturbed her&mdash;the idea of
deceiving an aunt who loved her had been less
to her than&mdash;than what? Less, at least, than the
pain of losing him forever, he reminded himself.
He tried to be just&mdash;to be generous. But at the
back of his mind, and not so very far back, either,
Iago's words echoed, "She did deceive her father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and may thee." His part of the deception now
seemed to him the blackest deed of his life, and
he could not undo it. It was impossible to turn
to this white shape, moving so quietly beside him,
with:</p>

<p>"Let's burn the certificate. Deceit is dishonorable."</p>

<p>If she did not think so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, women's code
of honor was different from men's. And she <em>had</em>
been willing to marry him in earnest, with no deceptions
or reservations. This mock business had
been, in the end, his doing, not hers. And now
they had gone through with it, and here he was
walking beside her, silent, like a resentful accomplice.
They had walked the street's length, its
whole dingy length, in silence. The light of life
had, once more, for Mr. Basingstoke, absolutely
gone out. They turned the corner, and still he
could find nothing to say; nor, it appeared, could
she. The hand with the paper hung loosely. The
other hand was busy at her belt&mdash;and now the
white rose fell on the dusty pavement, between
a banana-skin and a bit of torn printed paper. He
stooped, automatically, to pick up the rose.</p>

<p>"Don't," she said. "It's faded."</p>

<p>It so manifestly wasn't that he looked at her,
and on the instant the light of life began to be
again visible to him, very faint and far, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
pin-point of daylight at the end of a long tunnel,
but still visible. For he now perceived that for
her, too, the light had gone out&mdash;blown out, most
likely, by the same breath of remorse. Sublime
egoist! He was to have the monopoly of fine
sentiments and regretful indecisions, was he? Not
a thought for her, and what she must have been
feeling. But perhaps what she had felt had not
been that at all; yet something she had felt, something
not happy&mdash;something that led to the throwing
away of white roses.</p>

<p>"I can't let it lie there," he said, holding it in
his hand. "I should like to think," he added,
madly trying to find some words to break the
spell that, he now felt, held them both&mdash;"I should
like to think it would never fade."</p>

<p>She smiled at that&mdash;a small and pitiful smile.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," she said; "lots of people have got
<em>really</em> married and then parted, as they say, at
the church door. This is a perfect spot for a
parting," she added, a little wildly, waving toward
a corn-chandler's and a tobacconist's; "or, if your
chivalry won't let you desert me in this desolate
neighborhood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let me tell you something,
something to remember; you'll find it wonderfully
soothing and helpful. From this moment henceforth,
forever, every place in the world where we
are will be the best place for parting&mdash;if we want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to part. Isn't that almost as good as the freedom
you're crying your eyes out for?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," he said, absurdly; but she went on.</p>

<p>"Do you think I don't understand? Do you
think I don't know how you feel twenty times more
bound to me than if we were really married? Perhaps
it's only because everything's so new and
nasty. Perhaps you won't feel like that when you
get used to things. But if you do&mdash;if you don't
get over it then&mdash;it's all been for nothing, and we
might as well have parted among the pigeons."</p>

<p>She walked faster and faster.</p>

<p>"What we have to remember&mdash;oh yes, it's for
me as well as you&mdash;what we've got to remember is
that we're to be perfectly free. We needn't stay
with each other an instant after we wish not to
stay. Doesn't that help?"</p>

<p>"You're a witch," he said, keeping pace with
her quickened steps, "but you don't know everything.
And you're tired and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know quite enough," she said.</p>

<p>Never had he felt more helpless. Their aimless
walking was leading them into narrower and poorer
streets where her bridal whiteness caught the eye
and turned the head of every passer-by. The
pavements were choked with slow passengers and
playing children, small, dirty, pale, with the anxious
expression of little old men and women.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you like deer?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Deer?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;fawns, does, stags, antlers?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Then let's go to Richmond Park. Let's get
out of this."</p>

<p>The points of her white shoes showed like stars
among the filth of the pavement, her clean, clear
beauty shining against the drab and dirty houses
like a lily against a dust-heap. He felt a surge of
impotent fury that such a background should be
possible. The children, tired and pale with the
summer heat that had been so glad and gay and
shining to him and to her yesterday on the quiet
river, looked like some sort of living fungus&mdash;and
their clothes looked like decaying vegetables. If
Mr. Basingstoke had been alone he would have
solaced himself by going to the nearest baker's
and buying buns for every child in sight. But
somehow it is very difficult to do that sort of
thing unless you are alone or have a companion
who trusts you and whom you trust beyond the
limit of life's cheaper confidences. He felt that
self-exculpatory eagerness to give which certain
natures experience in the presence of sufferings
which they do not share. Also he felt&mdash;and hated
himself for feeling&mdash;a fear lest, if he should act
naturally, she might think he wanted to "show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
off." To show off what, in the name of all that
was pretentious and insincere? Had civilization
come to this, that a man was "showing off"
who took want as he found it and changed it,
without its costing him the least little loss or
self-denial, into a radiant, if momentary, satisfaction?
And yet, somehow, he found he could
not say, "Let's go and raid the bun-shop for
these kiddies."</p>

<p>"We're to pass our lives together, and I can't
say a simple thing like that," he thought, with
curious bitterness&mdash;but, indeed, all his thoughts
were confused and bitter just then.</p>

<p>What a travesty of a wedding-day! He would
have liked his wedding-feast to be in the big barn
of the bride's father, and every neighbor, rich and
poor, to have drunk their health in home-brewed
ale of the best, and the tables cleared away and
a jolly dance to follow, and when the fun was at
its merriest he and she would have slipped out and
ridden home to his own house on the white horse&mdash;Dobbin,
his name&mdash;she on the pillion behind him,
her arm soft about his waist, and the good horse
so sure of foot that he never stumbled, however
often his master turned his face back to the dear
face over his shoulder. Instead of which she had
consented to a mock marriage in a registry-office&mdash;and
this.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," he repeated.</p>

<p>"We are getting out of it," she said, and,
abruptly, "Don't people who have real weddings
pay the ringers and the beadle and give a feast
to the villagers&mdash;open house, and all that?"</p>

<p>He thrilled to the magic of that apt capping of
his thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and, not knowing why, hung on
her next words.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we?" she said, and her eyes wandered
to the rose he still carried. "Of course it was only
pretending, but we might pretend a little longer.
Couldn't we give our wedding-feast here? The
guests are all ready," she added, and her voice
trembled a little.</p>

<p>How seldom can man follow his desire. Edward
would have liked to fall on his knees among the
cabbage-stalks and the drifting dust and straw and
paper&mdash;to kneel before her and kiss her feet. For,
in that moment, and for the first time, he worshiped
her.</p>

<p>The imbecile irrationality of this will not have
escaped you. He worshiped her for the very
thought, the very impulse of simple loving-kindness
which he had been ashamed to let her
know as his own.</p>

<p>She kindled to the lighting of his face. "I knew
you would," she said. "You are a dear." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
same irrational admiration shone in her eyes.
"Sweets? Pounds and pounds of?"</p>

<p>"Buns," he answered, "buns and rock-cakes.
Sweets afterward, if you like," and enthusiastically
led the way to the nearest baker's.</p>

<p>Now this is difficult to believe and quite impossible
to explain, but it is true. No human
ear but their own had heard this interchange.
"Sweets," "buns," and "rock-cakes," those words
of power had, in fact, been spoken in the softest
whisper, but from the moment of their being
spoken a sort of wireless telegraphy ran down that
mean street from end to end, and by the time
they reached the baker's they had a ragged following
of some fifty children, while from court and
alley and narrow side-street came ever more and
more children, ragged children, stuffily dressed
children, children carrying bags, children carrying
parcels, children carrying babies and jugs and
jars and bundles. The crowd of children pressed
around the baker's door, and noses flattened like
the suckers of the octopus in aquariums marked
a long line across the window a little above the
level of the bun-trays. I do not pretend to explain
how this happened. Good news proverbially
travels fast. It also travels by ways past finding
out.</p>

<p>She began to take the buns by twos and threes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
from the tray in the window, and held them out.
A forest of lean arms reached up and a shrill
chorus of, "Me, teacher! Me!" varied by, "She's
'ad one&mdash;me next, teacher! Let the little boy 'ave
one, lady; 'e 'ain't 'ad nuffin."</p>

<p>The woman of the shop rolled forward. She
was as perfectly spherical as is possible to the
human form.</p>

<p>"Treat, sir?" she said, in a thick, rich, husky
voice (like cake, as Edward said later). They
owned her guess correct.</p>

<p>"How much'll you go to?"</p>

<p>"A bun apiece," said Edward.</p>

<p>"For the whole street? Why, there's hundreds!"</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," said Mr. Basingstoke.</p>

<p>"Do 'e mean it?" the woman asked, turning to
the bun-giver.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes." The girl turned from the door
to lean over the smooth deal counter. "It's our
wedding-day," she whispered, "and we didn't
give any wedding-breakfast, so we thought we'd
give one now."</p>

<p>Edward had turned to the door and was making
a speech.</p>

<p>"You shall all have a bun," he said, "to eat the
lady's health in. But it's one at a time. Now
you just hold on a minute and don't be impatient."</p>

<p>"Bless your good 'art, my dear," the globular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
lady was wheezing into the ear of the mock bride.
"Married to-day, was you? I'm sure you look it,
both of you&mdash;every inch you do. But we 'aven't
got the stuff in the place for 'arf that lot."</p>

<p>"How soon could you get it?"</p>

<p>"I could send a couple of the men out. Do it
in ten minutes&mdash;or less, if Prickets around the
corner's not sold out."</p>

<p>"How much will it cost&mdash;something for each
of them&mdash;cake if not buns&mdash;sweets if not cake&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The round woman made a swift mental calculation
and announced the result.</p>

<p>She who looked so much like a bride turned to
him who seemed her bridegroom. "Give me some
money, please, will you?"</p>

<p>Money changed hands, and changed again.</p>

<p>"Now, lookee 'ere," said the round one, "you
let me manage this 'ere for you. If you don't
you'll be giving three times over to the pushing
ones, and the quiet ones won't get nothing but
kicked shins and elbows in the pit of stomachs. I
know every man jack of them 'cept the hinfans in
arms, and even them I knows the ones as is carrying
of them. Wait till I send the chaps off for
the rest of the stuff."</p>

<p>The crowd outside surged excitedly, and the
frail arms still waved to the tune of, "Me next,
teacher!" All along the street the faces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
houses changed features as slatternly women and
shirt-sleeved men leaned out of the windows to
watch and wonder. When the baker's wife rolled
back into the shop she found the girl silent, with
lips that trembled.</p>

<p>"There, don't you upset yourself, my pretty,"
said the round one. "You'll like to give it to 'em
with your own hands, I lay. Take and begin on
what's before you&mdash;let 'em come in one door and
out of the other, and I'll see as they don't come
twice."</p>

<p>"You do it," said the girl, and she spoke to
Edward over her shoulder. "I didn't think it
would be like this. Tell them we've got to go,
but Mrs. Peacock will give them each a bun."</p>

<p>"How clever of her to have noticed the name,"
he thought; but he said, "Are you sure you
don't want to have the pleasure of seeing their
pleasure?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," she said. "Let's get away. I can't
bear it. Mrs. Peacock will see to it for us&mdash;won't
you?"</p>

<p>"That I will, lovey, and keep the change for you
against you call again. You can trust me."</p>

<p>"We don't want any change," she said. "Spend
it all on buns, or cake, or anything you like. It
<em>is</em> good of you. Oh, good-by, and thank you&mdash;so
much. I didn't think it would be like this," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
said, and gave Mrs. Peacock both hands, while
Edward explained to the crowd outside.</p>

<p>A wail of disappointment went up, but stayed
itself as Mrs. Peacock rushed to the door.</p>

<p>"It's all true," she said, in that thick, rich,
caky voice; "every good little boy and gell's to
have a bun. Now then," she added, in a perfect
blaze of tactlessness, "three cheers for the bride
and bridegroom, and many happy returns."</p>

<p>The two had to stand side by side and hear
those shrill, thin cheers, strengthened by the
voices of fathers and mothers at the windows.
He had to wave his hat to the crowd and to be
waved at in return from every window in the
street&mdash;even those too far away for their occupants
to have any certain idea why they cheered
and waved. She had to bow and kiss her hand to
the children and to bow and smile to the window-dwellers.</p>

<p>Next moment she was out of the shop and running
like a deer along a side-street, he following.
They took hands and ran; and by luck their
street brought them to a road where trams were,
and escape. They rode on the top of the tram,
and she held his hand all the way to Charing
Cross. I cannot explain this. Neither of them
spoke a word. Further, it was almost without a
word that they got themselves to Richmond. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was not till they had been for many minutes in
the deep quiet of the bracken and green leafage
that she spoke, with a little laugh that had more
than laughter in it.</p>

<p>"We might almost as well," she said, "have
been married in church."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WARWICK</div>


<div class='cap'>ONLY those who have gone through the ceremony
of a mock marriage, from the gentlest
motives, and have soothed the solicitude of a beloved
and invalid aunt by the gift of the marriage
certificate thus obtained, can have any idea of the
minor difficulties which beset the path of the
really unselfish. Had the ceremony been one in
which either party was deceived as to its real
nature the sequent embarrassments would have
been far less. The first and greatest was the
question of names. The persons mentioned in the
certificate now bedewed by the joyful tears of the
invalid aunt, and scorched by the fierce fires of a
first-class family row, were committed, so far as the
family and the world knew, to a wedding-journey.
That is to say, Mr. and Mrs. Basingstoke, after
posting the certificate, were to proceed on their
honeymoon. But cold mock marriages claim no
honeymoon. So far the only explanation of the
relations of the now mockly married had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
made to Mr. Schultz across the peaches in the
sunned and shadowy arbor at Tunbridge Wells.
To Mr. Schultz the two were brother and sister.
To travel as Mr. and Mrs. Basingstoke presented
difficulties almost insurmountable&mdash;to pursue their
wanderings as Mr. and Miss Basingstoke involved
bother about letters and the constant risk of explanations
to any of the friends and relations of
either across whose path fate might be spiteful
enough to drive them. Because, of course, your
friends and relations know how many brothers
and sisters you have and what they look like, and
those sort of people never forget. You could
never persuade them that the young man with
whom you were traveling was a brother whom they
had overlooked or forgotten.</div>

<p>A long silence in the train that meant to go to
Warwick was spent by each in the same tangle of
puzzle and conjecture. They had the carriage to
themselves. Her eyes were on the green changing
picture framed by the window; his eyes noted the
firm, pretty line of her chin, the way her hair
grew, the delicate charm of the pale roses under
the curve of her hat-brim&mdash;the proud carriage of
head and neck; he liked the way she held herself,
the way her hands lay in her lap, the self-possession
and self-respect that showed in every line of
that gracious figure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The four walls of the carriage seemed to shut
them in with a new and deeper intimacy than
yesterday's. He would have liked to hold her
hand as he had held it on the way to Richmond&mdash;to
have her shoulder lightly touching his and to
sit by her and watch the changing of that green
picture from which she never turned her eyes.
And all the time the two alternatives seesawed at
the back of his mind: "Mr. and Mrs. or Mr. and
Miss?"</p>

<p>Her eyes suddenly left the picture and met his.
In that one glance she knew what sort of thoughts
had been his, and knew also quite surely and unmistakably,
as women do know such things, that
the relations between them had been changed by
that mock marriage&mdash;that now it would not be he
who would make the advances. That he was hers
for the asking, she knew, but she also knew that
there would have to be asking, and that asking
hers. She knew then, as well as she knew it later,
that that act had set a barrier between them and
that his would never be the hand to break it down;
a barrier strong as iron, behind which she could, if
she would, remain alone forever&mdash;and yet a barrier
which, if she chose that it should be so, her
choice could break at a touch, as bubbles are
broken. She felt as perhaps a queen in old romance
might have felt traveling through the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
served only by a faithful knight. That they had
held each other's hand on their wedding-day had
been an accident. This would never happen again&mdash;unless
she made it happen.</p>

<p>"We must have our letters sent to the post-offices
where we go," she said, suddenly, turning
to the problem at the back of her mind. "Then
the aunts can call me 'Mrs.' when they write to
me. I suppose they'll want to <em>call</em> me that?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Basingstoke," he said, slowly. "Yes, it
seems likely that they <em>will</em> want to."</p>

<p>"Then," she went on, "we needn't pretend to
the hotel people that we're married. They'd be
sure to find out we weren't, or something, and we
should always be trembling on the perilous edge
of detection. I couldn't bear to be always wondering
whether the landlord had found us out."</p>

<p>"It would be intolerable," he agreed, deeply
conscious of the admirable way in which she
grasped this delicate nettle. "Whereas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Whereas if we're Mr. and Miss Basingstoke at
our hotels, and Mr. and Mrs. at the post-office, it's
all as simple as the Hebrew alphabet."</p>

<p>"The Hebrew.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's not quite as simple as A B C, but
very nearly. So that's settled."</p>

<p>"What," he asked, hastily, anxious to show his
sense of a difficulty avoided, a subject dismissed&mdash;"what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
do you think about when you look out of
the windows in trains? Or don't you think at all&mdash;just
let the country flow through your soul as
though it were music?"</p>

<p>"One does that when one's <em>in</em> it," she answered,
"in woods and meadows and in those deep lanes
where you see nothing but the hedges and the
cart-tracks&mdash;and on the downs&mdash;yes. But when
you look out at the country it's different, isn't it?
One looks at the churches and thinks about all the
people who were christened and married and
buried there, and then you look at the houses
they lived in&mdash;the old farm-houses more than anything.
Do you know, all my life I've wished I'd
been born a farmer's daughter. All the little
things of life in those thatched homesteads are
beautiful to me. The smell of the wood smoke,
and the way all your life is next door to out-of-doors&mdash;always
having to go out and feed the
calves or the pigs or the fowls, and always little
young things, the goslings and the ducklings and
the chicks&mdash;you know how soft and pretty they
are. And all these lovely little live things dependent
on you. And the men as well&mdash;they come
home tired from their work and you have their
meals all ready&mdash;the bread you've baked yourself,
and the pasties you've made&mdash;perhaps, even, you
brew the beer and salt the pork&mdash;and they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in, your husband and your father and your brothers,
and they think what a good housekeeper you
are, and love you for it. Or if you're a man
yourself, all your work's out of doors with the
nice, clean earth and making things grow, and
seeing the glorious seasons go round and round
like a splendid kaleidoscope; and in the winter
coming home through the dusk and seeing the
dancing light of your own hearth-fire showing
through the windows, till you go into the warm,
cozy place, and then the red curtains are drawn and
the door is shut, and you're safe inside&mdash;at home."</p>

<p>He felt in every word a new intimacy, a new
confidence. For the first time she was speaking
to him from the heart without afterthought and
without reservations. And he knew why. He
knew that the queen, confident and confiding,
spoke to the faithful knight. And the matter of
her speech no less than its manner enchanted him
so that he could think of nothing better to say
than:</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;tell me some more."</p>

<p>"There isn't any more, only I think that must
have been the life I lived in my last incarnation,
because a little house in the country&mdash;any little
house, even an old turnpike cottage&mdash;always
seems to call out to me, 'Here I am! Come home!
What a long time you've been away!'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet," he said, and felt, as he said it, how
stupid he was being&mdash;"and yet you love traveling
and adventure&mdash;seeing the world and the
wonders of the world."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "that's my new incarnation.
But what the old one loved goes deeper than that.
I love adventure and new bits of the world as I
love strawberries and ice-cream, and waltzing and
Chopin, but the little house in the green country
is like the daily bread of the heart."</p>

<p>"I understand you," he said, slowly. "I understand
you in the only possible way. I mean that's
the way I feel about it, too. If you were really my
sister, what a united family the last of the Basingstokes
would be."</p>

<p>"Do you really feel the same about it&mdash;you,
too?" she asked. "Oh, what a pity I wasn't born
Basingstoke, and we would have lived on our own
farm and been happy all our lives."</p>

<p>He would not say what he might have said, and
her heart praised him for not saying it. And so
at last they came to Warwick, and Charles had
bounded from the dog-box all pink tongue and
white teeth and strenuous white-covered muscles,
and knocked down a little boy in a blue jersey,
who had to be consoled by chocolate which came
out of the machine like the god in the Latin tag.
And then all the luggage was retrieved&mdash;there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
getting to be a most respectable amount of it, as
she pointed out&mdash;and it and they and Charles got
into a fly (for there are still places where an open
carriage bears that ironic name) and drove through
the afternoon sunshine to the Warwick Arms.
But when they were asked to write their names in
the visitors' book, each naturally signed a Christian
name, and the management, putting two and
two together, deduced Mr. and Mrs. Basingstoke,
and entered this result in more intimate books,
living in retirement in the glass case which preserves
the young lady who knows all about which
rooms you can have. The chambermaid and the
boots agreed that Mr. and Mrs. Basingstoke were
a handsome couple. Also, when a new-comer, signing
his name, asked a question about the signatures
just above his, "Mr. and Mrs. Basingstoke,"
was the answer he got.</p>

<p>Now all this time, for all her frankness, she
had been concealing something from him.</p>

<p>You must know that the wedding-dinner, if a
mock marriage can be said to involve a wedding-dinner,
had been at the Star and Garter, and after
the wooded slopes and the shining spaces of the
river her London hotel had seemed but a dull and
dusty resting-place. And it was she who had met
him when he called to take her out to breakfast
with a petition for more river. So they had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
more river, in the shape of a Sunday at Coohmah,
where the beautiful woods lean down to the water,
and the many boats keep to the stream and the
few creep into backwaters whither the swans
follow you, and eat all the lunch if you will only
give them half a chance. It was a delightful day,
full of incident and charm. The cool, gleaming
river, the self-possessed gray poplars, the generous,
green-spreading beeches, the lovelorn willows
trailing their tresses in the stream, the reeds and
the rushes, the quiet, emphasized by the knowledge
that but for the supremest luck they might
have been two in a very large and noisy party,
such as that on the steam-launch which thrust its
nose into their backwater and had to back out
with fussings and snortings, like a terrier out of a
rabbit-hole. The dappled shadows on the spread
carpet of lily-leaves, the green gleams in the deep
darkness of the woods, the slow, dripping veil of
dusk through which they rowed slowly back to
the inn&mdash;even being late for the train and having
to run for it&mdash;all, as he said, when they had caught
the train and were crammed into a first-class
carriage with three boating-men, a painted lady,
an aged beau, and a gentleman almost of color,
from Brazil&mdash;all had been very good. But he did
not know all. There had been a moment, while
he had gone in to the bar of the inn to settle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the boat&mdash;a moment in which she waited in the
little grassy garden that shelves down to the
river's edge&mdash;and in that moment a boat slid up
to the landing-stage. The first man to get out of
it was nobody, and didn't matter. The second
was Mr. Schultz. As it happened, her face was
lighted by a yellow beam from one of the inn
windows, and as he landed the beam from the
other window fell across his face, so that they saw
and recognized each other in a blaze of light that
might have been arranged for no other purpose.</p>

<p>He raised his cap and she saw that he meant to
speak, but one of his companions thrust the
painter into his hand at exactly the nick of time.
He was held there, for the moment. She had the
sense to walk slowly into the inn, and Mr. Schultz
might well have thought that she was staying
there. She meant him to think so. Anyhow, he
did not cast the painter from him, as he might
have done, and hurry after her. "Later on will
do," was what his attitude and his look expressed.</p>

<p>The moment she was out of his sight she
quickened her pace, found Mr. Edward Basingstoke
in the bar putting his change in his pocket,
and, the moment the two were outside the street
door, said, just, "We must run for it." This was,
providentially, true. And they ran for it, just
catching it, without a breath to spare.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Why did she not tell him that she had seen
Schultz, that stout squire of the South Coast
road? For one thing, Mr. Schultz seemed long
ago and irrelevant. For another, he was discordant,
and his very name, spoken, would break the
spell of a very charming quiet which had infolded
her and Edward all day long. Then there
was the crowded carriage with the Brazilian gentleman,
all observant, black, beady eye, and long
yellow ear. And then, anyhow, what was the
good of raking up Mr. Schultz, whom Edward had
never really liked. So she did not tell him. Nor,
for much the same reason, did he tell her that one
of that shouting party who climbed into the train
after it had actually started, and whom he saw as
he leaned out of the window to buy chocolate from
an accidental boy, was very like that chap Schultz&mdash;as
like, in fact, as two peas.</p>

<p>And the next day she packed up everything, and
he packed up a good deal, and they started for
Warwick; arrived there, had luncheon, and became
immediately a pair of ardent sight-seers.</p>

<p>The guide-book in the coffee-room assured them
that "no visitor to Warwick with any sense of
propriety thinks of remaining long without paying
his respects to that historic and majestic pile
known as Warwick Castle," and this, they agreed,
settled the question.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went and saw Warwick Castle, with its
great gray towers and its high gray walls, its
green turf, and old, old trees. They saw the banqueting-hall
that was burned down, and Guy's
punch-bowl that holds Heaven knows how many
gallons.</p>

<p>"It makes you thirsty to look at it," said
Edward.</p>

<p>Also they saw the Portland vase which lives in
a glass house all by itself, and the bed where Queen
Anne slept, and the cedar drawing-room and the
red drawing-room and the golden drawing-room,
and all the other rooms which are "shown to visitors,"
and longed lawlessly to see the rooms that
are not so shown.</p>

<p>"There must be <em>some</em> comfortable rooms in the
house," she said. "Even lords and ladies and Miss
O'Gradys couldn't really live in these museums."
And, indeed, all the rooms they saw were much
too full of things curious, precious, beautiful, and
ugly; but mostly large and all costly.</p>

<p>"It must be pretty awful to be as rich as all
this," said Edward, as they came out of the
castle gate.</p>

<p>"Would it be? The guide-books say Lady Warwick
says she strives to fulfil, imperfectly, it may
be, the duties of her stewardship and the privileges
of her heritage. It would be interesting, don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
you think, to find out just exactly what those
were?"</p>

<p>"If I had a castle," said he, "there shouldn't be
a knickknack in it, nor a scrap of furniture later
than seventeen hundred."</p>

<p>"I sometimes wonder whether it's fair," she
said, "the way we collect old things. Have you
noticed that poor people's houses haven't a decent
bit of furniture in them? When my mother
was little the cottages used to have old bureaus
and tables and chests that had come down from
father to son and from mother to daughter."</p>

<p>"It's true," said he, "and the worst of it is that
we've not only taken away their furniture, but
we've taken away their taste for it. They prefer
plush and machine-made walnut to the old oak
and elm and beech and apple-wood. It would be
no good to give them back their old furnishing
unless we could give them back their love of it.
And that we can't do."</p>

<p>"But if we bought modern things?"</p>

<p>"Even then they wouldn't care for the old ones.
And the only beautiful modern things we have are
imitations of the old ones. We've lost the art of
furniture-making, and the art of architecture, and
we're losing even the art of life. It's getting to be
machine-made, like our chair-legs and our stone
facings. I sometimes wonder whether we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
really on the down-grade&mdash;and whether the grade
is so steep that we sha'n't be able to stop&mdash;and go
on till there's no life possible except the life that's
represented by the plush and walnut at one end
and motors and the Ritz at the other."</p>

<p>"Can't we resist? all the people who still care
for beautiful things?"</p>

<p>"We can collect them; it's not taking them from
the poor now&mdash;it's taking them from the dealers
who have cleared out the farms and cottages and
little houses. I suppose one might make a nest,
and live in it, but that wouldn't change things or
stop the uglification of everything. You can't
make people live beautifully by act of Parliament.
The impulse to make and own beautiful things has
to come from within&mdash;and it seems as though it
were dead&mdash;killed by machinery and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>
and the gospel of individualism, and I'm sorry to
talk like a Fabian tract, but there it is. Forgive
me, and let's go down to Guy's Cliff and see the
Saxon Mill and the perfect beauty of mixed architecture
that wasn't trying to imitate anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, but go on with the tract."</p>

<p>"There isn't any more, except that what's so
difficult is to know how to live without hurting
some one else. This is my wander year. I'm
spending my money just now for fun and to have
a good time. I feel I deserve a holiday and I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
taking one. But what's one to do with one's life?
How can one use one's money so as to do no harm?"</p>

<p>"If you invest it in mines or factories or railways,
doesn't that employ people and make trade
better?" she asked, diffidently. "I'm sure I've
heard people say so."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, grimly, "so have I. And, of
course, it's true. You launch your money into
this horrible welter of hard work and chancy
wages, and it helps to keep some people in motors
and fur coats and champagne and diamonds, and
it helps, too, to keep others on the perilous edge
of despair, to keep them alive in a world where
they're never sure of next week's meals, never free
from worry from the cradle to the grave, with no
poetry in their lives but love, and no magic but
drink."</p>

<p>"But what are we to do?" she asked, and they
paused a moment on the bridge to look to the
splendid mass of Warwick Castle along the river
where the swans float and the weeping willows
trail their hair in the water.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," he said. "There must be
some way to live without having any part in the
muddle."</p>

<p>"We'll find a way," said she. And his heart
leaped, for he knew that this was the most intimate
thing she had ever said to him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>STRATFORD-ON-AVON</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN you have seen Warwick Castle and
Guy's Cliff and the Saxon Mill&mdash;which is
so old that it must be soothing to the most tempestuous
temperament&mdash;and you hasten back to
your hotel and get your dog&mdash;if that dog be
Charles&mdash;on purpose to expose him to its calm influences,
you go to St. Mary's Church, which is,
the guide-book tells you, "one of the most remarkable
specimens of ecclesiastical architecture
extant," and you see the Norman Crypt, and the
clumsy sarcophagus of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke,
who wrote his own epitaph, and you read how he
was "servant to Queen Elizabeth, Canceller to
King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney."</div>

<p>Also you see the Beauchamp Chapel, and love
it and linger in it, admiring the tombs of the earls
of Warwick and other grown-ups, and feeling, even
after all these years, a thrill of sadness at the
sight of the little effigy of the child whose brocaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
gown the marble so wonderfully produces
and whose little years knock at your heart for pity.</p>

<p>"Here resteth," says the monument, "the body
of the noble Impe Robert of Dudley, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a child
of greate parentage, but of farre greater hope and
towardness, taken from this transitory unto the
everlasting life in his tender age, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on Sunday
the 19 of July, in the yeare of our Lorde God
1584."</p>

<p>You see, also, the Warwick pew, and wish you
could have worshiped there.</p>

<p>Then you go to Leicester's Hospital, half
timbered and beautiful, with the row of whispering
limes on its terraced front, where the "brethren"
still wear the "gown of blew stuff with the
badge of the bear and ragged staff on the left
sleeve." And the badges are still those provided
by Lord Leicester in 1571.</p>

<p>You are sorry that the old banqueting-hall
should now be used for the coal-cellar and the
laundry of the brethren, and still more sorry that
the minstrels' gallery should have been cut off to
enlarge the drawing-room of the Master's house.
If you are of a rude and democratic nature you
may possibly comment on this in audible voices
beneath the Master's windows, which, I am sorry
to say, was what Mr. Basingstoke and his companion
did.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>You will see the Sidney porcupine on the wall
of the quadrangle, some gilded quills missing, and
no wonder, after all these years. You will see&mdash;and
perhaps neglect to reverence, as they did&mdash;the
great chair once occupied by that insufferable
monarch and prig, James the First. You will
visit the Brethren's Chapel, which seems to be
scented by all the old clothes ever worn by any of
the old brethren, and you will come out again into
the street, and, as you cross the threshold, it will
be like stepping across three hundred years, and
you will say so. Then you will probably say,
"What about Stratford for this afternoon?" At
least, that is what Edward said. And as he said
it he was aware of a figure in black which said,</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the way to Droitwich?"</p>

<p>It was a woman, spare and pale, in black that
was green, but brushed to threadbareness.</p>

<p>"Do you want to walk?" Edward asked.</p>

<p>"I've got to, sir," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you mind," he asked, "telling me why you
want to go?"</p>

<p>"I've got relations there, sir," said the woman
in black, raising to his the plaintive blue eyes of
a child set in a face that fifty years and more had
wrinkled like a February apple. "My husband's
relations, that is. They might do something to
help me. I might be able to be of use to them, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to work out my keep. It isn't much I require.
But I couldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, and Edward Basingstoke knew
that she couldn't even bring herself to name the
great terror of the poor&mdash;the living tomb which
the English call the workhouse.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've had a hard time," said Mr.
Basingstoke.</p>

<p>"I had many happy days," she said, simply.
"I always think you pay for everything you have,
sooner or later. And I'm paying now. I don't
grudge it, but I'd like to end respectable. And
thank you for asking so kindly, sir, and now I'll
be getting on." And he saw in her eyes the fear
that he would offer her money to pay her way to
Droitwich.</p>

<p>Instead he said: "We're motoring your way
this afternoon. If you'll let us give you a lift&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman looked from one to the other.
"Well," she said, "I do call that kind. But I
wasn't asking for any help. And I'd best be
getting on."</p>

<p>Then the other woman came quite close to the
woman in black. "Won't you," she said, "come
and have dinner with us&mdash;and then we'll drive
you over? Do come. We're so happy and we do
hate to think that you aren't. Perhaps we can
think of some way to help you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. find you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
some work or something," she added, hastily,
answering the protest in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't like to, miss," she said, "thanking you
all the same. It's truly good of you&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edward moved away a pace or two and lit a
cigarette. He never knew what his lady said to
the woman in black, but when he turned again a
handkerchief was being restored to a rubbed black
leather reticule and the woman in black was saying,</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, since you say that, of course I
can't say no, and thank you kindly."</p>

<p>The three had dinner together in the little
private room over the porch at the Warwick Arms,
and as they passed through the hall there could
have been, for the little woman in black, no better
armor against the sniffs of chambermaids and the
cold eyes of the lady in the glass case than the
feel of another woman's hand on her arm. She
was very silent and shy, but not awkward or
clumsy, during the meal, and when it was finished
Edward got up and said,</p>

<p>"Well, Katherine, I'll leave you two to talk
things over."</p>

<p>It was the first time he had called her by her
name. She flushed and sparkled, and was startled
and amazed next moment to know that she had
answered,</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, do&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward, however, was not unduly elated. He
knew how women will play the part set for them,
to the least detail. She hoped he had not noticed
the slip which, quite unconsciously, the opening
of her heart toward this sad sister-woman had led
her to make. He wished that she had not first
called him that in a mere desire to act up to what
this woman would expect.</p>

<p>He left them, and then the pitiful little story
all came out, with fit accompaniment of sighs,
and presently tears, together with those sweet
and tender acts and words which blend with the
sighs and tears of the sorrowful into a melody as
sad as beautiful. They had been married thirty-seven
years next Michaelmas; they had had a
little shop&mdash;a little needlework and fancy shop.
She had done well enough with the customers, but
he had always done the buying, and when he was
taken.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, don't cry," said the one who was
young and happy, "don't cry. You'll make him
so sad."</p>

<p>"Do you think he knows?" the widow asked.</p>

<p>"Of course he knows. He knows everything's
going to be all right, only he hates to see you miserable.
<em>He</em> knows it's only a little time, really,
before you and he will be together again, and happy
for ever and ever."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that."</p>

<p>"You must, because it's true. I expect he's
been praying for you, and that's why you met us&mdash;because,
you know, I'm certain my"&mdash;she hesitated,
but the word came instead of "brother,"
which was what she thought she meant to say&mdash;"my
husband will think of something for you to
do to earn your living; he's so clever. And I
suppose the business&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes. The business had gone to pieces. Fashions
change so, and the widow had not known how
to follow the fashions in needlework. There was
only enough left to pay the creditors, but every
one <em>had</em> been paid, and with the pound or
two left over she had lived, trying to get needle
work, or even, at last, charring or washing. But
it had all been no good; nothing had been any
good.</p>

<p>"And now," said Katherine, "everything's
going to be good. You'll see. Edward will think
of something. Don't cry any more. You must
not cry. I can't bear it, dear. Don't."</p>

<p>"I'm only crying for joy," said the woman
whose life was over. "Even if he doesn't think of
anything, I can't ever despair again, and you
being like you have to me."</p>

<p>But when Edward came back he had thought
of something. His old nurse, it seemed, was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
temporary charge of a house that wanted a housekeeper,
and he was sure Mrs. Burbidge understood
housekeeping.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burbidge owned to an understanding of
plain cooking and plain housekeeping. Also
needlework, both the plain and the fine. "But
not where butlers are kept," she said, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"This is a farm-house," said Edward. "Not a
butler within miles."</p>

<p>"My father was a farmer, in Somerset," said
Mrs. Burbidge, "but, oh, sir, you don't know
anything about me. Suppose I was a fraud like
you read of in the newspapers. But the vicar at
home would speak for me."</p>

<p>"Your face speaks for you," said Katherine,
and within half an hour all was settled&mdash;the old
nurse telegraphed to, money found for such modest
outfit as even a farmer's housekeeper must
have, the train fixed that should take the widow
to London, the little hotel named where she
should spend a night, and the train decided on
that should take her in the morning to the farm-house
that needed a housekeeper.</p>

<p>"It's no use me saying anything," said Mrs.
Burbidge, at parting, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to say," said Katherine, and
kissed her, "only you will write to the Reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Smilie at Eccles vicarage. I can't be easy unless
you do," were her last words.</p>

<p>When she was gone they stood a moment
looking at each other, and each would have liked
to hold out hands to the other, to come quite close
in the ecstasy of a kind deed jointly done. Instead
of which he said, awkwardly:</p>

<p>"I suppose that was a thoroughly silly thing
to do."</p>

<p>And she answered, "Oh, well, let's hope it will
turn out all right."</p>

<p>An interchange which left both of them chilled
and a little disenchanted.</p>

<p>It was Edward who had the sense to say, as the
motor whirled them toward Stratford, "That was
all nonsense, you know, that we said just now."</p>

<p>She was disingenuous enough to say, "What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About Mrs. Burbidge perhaps not being all
right. She's as right as rain. I don't know what
made me say it."</p>

<p>"A sort of 'do-good-by-stealth-and-blush-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits the hyphen between these two words">to-find</ins>-it-fame'
feeling, I expect, wasn't it? Of course
she's all right. You know I knew you knew she
was, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I know now," said he. "Yes, of course I
knew it. Don't let's pretend we aren't both jolly
glad we met her."</p>

<p>"No, don't let's," said she. And laid her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
on his. His turned under it and held it, lightly
yet tenderly, as his hand knew that hers would
wish to be held, and not another word did either
say till their car drew up at the prosperous, preposterous
Shakespeare Inn at Stratford-on-Avon.
But all through the drive soft currents of mutual
kindness and understanding, with other electricities
less easy to classify, ran from him to her and
from her to him, through the contact of their
quiet clasped hands.</p>

<p>The inn at Stratford is intolerably half timbered.
Whatever there may have been of the old woodwork
is infinitely depreciated by the modern
imitation which flaunts itself everywhere. The
antique mockery is only skin deep and does not
extend to the new rooms, each named after one
of Shakespeare's works, and all of a peculiarly
unpleasing shape, and furnished exactly like the
rooms of any temperance hotel. The room where
Katherine washed the dust of the road from her
pretty face was called "The Tempest," and the
sitting-room where they had tea was a hideous
oblong furnished in the worst taste of the middle-Victorian
lower middle class, and had "Hamlet"
painted on its door.</p>

<p>"We must see the birthplace, I suppose," said
Edward, "but before we go I should like to warn
you that there is not a single authentic relic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Shakespeare, unless it's the house where they say
he was born, and even that was never said to be
his birthplace till a hundred and fifty years after
his death, and even then two other houses claimed
the same honor. If ever a man was born in three
places at once, like a bird, that man was William
Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"You aren't a Baconian, are you?" she asked,
looking at him rather timidly across the teacups.
"But you can't be, because I know they're all
mad."</p>

<p>"A good many of them are very, very silly,"
he owned, "but don't be afraid. I'm not a Baconian,
for Baconians are convinced that Bacon wrote
the whole of Elizabethan and Jacobean literature
off his own bat. I only think there's a mystery.
You remember Dickens said the life of Shakespeare
was a fine mystery and he trembled daily
lest something should turn up."</p>

<p>"And nothing has."</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's just it. There's hardly anything
known about the man. He was born here&mdash;died
here. He went to London and acted. One of
his contemporaries says that the top of his performance
was the Ghost in 'Hamlet.' He married,
he had children, he got hold of money enough
to buy a house, he got a coat of arms, he lent
money and dunned people for it, he speculated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
corn, he made a will in which he mentions neither
his plays nor his books, but is very particular
about his second-best bed and his silver-gilt bowl.
He died, and was buried. That's all that's known
about him. I'm not a Baconian, Princess, but
I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote 'Hamlet,'
that frowzy, money-grubbing provincial never
did."</p>

<p>"But we'll go and see his birthplace, all the
same, won't we?" she said.</p>

<p>And they went.</p>

<p>If she desired to worship at the shrine of
Shakespeare he did not give her much chance.
She listened to the talk of the caretaker, but always
he was at her ear with the tale of how often
Shakespeare's chair had been sold and replaced
by a replica, how the desk shown as his is that of
an eighteenth-century usher and not of a sixteenth-century
scholar. How the ring engraved "W. S."
was found in the surface of the ground, near the
church, in 1810, where, one supposes, it had lain
unnoticed since Shakespeare dropped it there two
hundred years before.</p>

<p>At the grammar-school Edward pointed out that
there is no evidence to show that Shakespeare
ever attended this or any other school. Anne
Hathaway's cottage could not be allowed to be
Anne Hathaway's, since it was only in 1770 that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
its identity was fixed on, two other houses having
previously shared the honor. Like her husband,
she would seem to have possessed the peculiar gift
of being born in three places at once.</p>

<p>"I don't think I like it," she said at last. "I'd
rather believe everything they say. It's such a
very big lot of lies, if they are lies. Let's go to the
church. The man's grave's his own, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said he, but not with much
conviction; "anyhow, I won't bore you with any
more of the stuff. But it <em>is</em> a fine mystery, and
there's a corner of me that would like to live in
Bloomsbury and grub among books all day at the
British Mu. and half the night in my booky little
den, and see if I couldn't find something out. But
the rest of me wants different things, out-of-door
things, and things that lead to something more
than finding the key to a door locked three hundred
years ago."</p>

<p>The bust of Shakespeare in Stratford Church is
a great blow to the enthusiast. A stubby, sensual,
Dutch-looking face.</p>

<p>"I wish they'd been content with the gravestone,"
she said, and read aloud the words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Goodfrend for Jesus sake forbeare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To digg the dust encloasèd heare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blest be ye man yt spares these stones</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And curst be he yt moves my bones."</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's not much chance of any one doing
that&mdash;look, the altar-step goes right across the
tombstone. I wonder what they <em>would</em> find, if
they <em>did</em> move the stone."</p>

<p>"Nothing, madam," said a voice behind her&mdash;"nothing
human, that is."</p>

<p>She turned to face a tall, gaunt man in loose,
ill-fitting clothes with a despatch-case in one hand
and three or four note-books in the other. "Excuse
my joining in," he said, "but I couldn't help
hearing what you said. Whatever there is in that
tomb, there is not the body of the man Shakespeare.
Manuscripts there may be, but no corpse."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Evidence, madam, evidence. The evidence of
facts as well as of ciphers."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, and smiled brilliantly, "you
must be a Baconian. How very interesting!"</p>

<p>Now she had received all Edward's criticisms of
Shakespearian legend with a growing and visible
impatience. Yet for this stranger she had nothing
but sympathy and interest.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> interesting," said the stranger. "There's
nothing like it. I've spent eighteen years on it,
and I know now how little I know. It isn't only
Bacon and Shakespeare; it's a great system&mdash;a
great cipher system extending through all the
great works of the period."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what is it that you hope to find out in
the end?" she asked. "Secrets of state, or the
secret of the philosopher's stone, or what?"</p>

<p>"The truth," he said, simply. "There's nothing
else worth looking for. The truth, whatever it is.
To follow truth, no matter where it leads. I'd go
on looking, even if I thought that at the end I
should find that that Stratford man did write the
plays." He looked up contemptuously at the
smug face of the bust.</p>

<p>"It's a life's work," said Mr. Basingstoke, "and
I should think more than one life's work. Do you
find that you can bring your mind to any other
kind of work?"</p>

<p>"I gave up everything else," said the stranger.
"I was an accountant, and I had some money and
I'm living on it. But now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now I shall have
to do something else. I've got a situation in
London. I'm going there next week. It's the end
of everything for me."</p>

<p>"There ought to be some endowment for your
sort of research," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Of course there ought," said the man, eagerly,
"but people don't care. The few who do care
don't want the truth to come out. They want to
keep that thing"&mdash;he pointed to the bust&mdash;"to
keep that thing enthroned on its pedestal forever.
It pays, you see. Great is Diana of the Ephesians."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose it wouldn't need to be a very handsome
endowment. I mean that sort of research
work can be done at museums. You don't have
to buy the books," Edward said.</p>

<p>"A lot can be done with libraries, of course.
But I have a few books&mdash;a good few. I should
like to show them to you some day&mdash;if you're
interested in the subject."</p>

<p>"I am," said Edward, with a glance at the girl,
"or I used to be. Anyhow, I should like very
much to see your books. You have a Du Bartas,
of course?"</p>

<p>"Three," said the stranger, "and six of the
Sylva Sylvarum, and Argalus and Perthenia&mdash;do
you know that&mdash;Quarles&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Next moment the two men were up to the eyes
in a flood of names, none of which conveyed anything
to her. But she saw that Edward was happy.
At the same time, the hour was latish. She waited
for the first pause&mdash;a very little one&mdash;but she
drove the point of her wedge into it sharply.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice if you were to come back
to dinner with us, at Warwick, then we should
have lots of time to talk."</p>

<p>"I was going to London to-night," said the
stranger, "but if Warwick can find me a night's
lodging I shall only too gladly avail myself of
your gracious invitation, Mrs.&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Basingstoke," said Edward.</p>

<p>The stranger had produced a card and she read
on it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Dr. C. P. Vandervelde</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Ohio College, U. S. A.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'm an American. I think
almost all serious Baconians are. I hope you
haven't a prejudice against my country, Mrs.
Basingstoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's Miss Basingstoke," she said, thinking of
the hotel, "and I've never met an American that
I didn't like."</p>

<p>He made her a ceremonious and old-fashioned
bow. "Inscrutable are the ways of fate," he said.
"Only this morning I was angry because the
chambermaid at my inn in Birmingham destroyed
my rubbing of the grave inscription, and I had to
come to Stratford to get another. Yes, I could
have written, but it was so near, and I shall soon
be chained to an office desk&mdash;and now, in this of
all spots, I meet youth and beauty and sympathy
and hospitality. It is an omen."</p>

<p>"And what," she asked, as they paced down the
church, "was the cipher that said there was nothing
in the tomb? Or would you rather not talk
about your ciphers?"</p>

<p>"I desire nothing better than to talk of them,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he answered. "It's the greatest mistake to keep
these things secret. We ought all to tell all we
know&mdash;and if we all did that and put together the
little fragment of knowledge we have gathered,
we should soon piece together the whole puzzle.
The first words I found on the subject are,
'Reader, read all, no corpse lies in this tomb,'
and so on, and with the same letters another
anagram in Latin, beginning '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lector intra sepulcho
jacet nullum cadaver</i>.' I'll show you how I got it
when we're within reach of a table and light."</p>

<p>They lingered a moment on the churchyard
terrace where the willows overhang the Avon and
the swans move up and down like white-sailed
ships.</p>

<p>"How hospitable we're getting," she said to
Edward that night when their guest had gone
to his humbler inn&mdash;"two visitors in one day!"</p>

<p>"Katherine," he said, just for the pleasure of
saying it, for they two were alone, so he could not
have been speaking to any one else&mdash;"Katherine,
that man's ciphers are wonderful. And what a
gift of the gods&mdash;to possess an interest that can
never fail and that costs nothing for its indulgence,
not like postage-stamps or orchids or
politics or racing!"</p>

<p>"The ciphers were wonderful," she said. "I
had no idea such things were possible. I understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
quite a lot," she added, a little defiantly.
"But it's rather hateful to think of his being
chained to a desk doing work that isn't <em>his</em> work."</p>

<p>"That, or something like it, is the lot of most
people," he said, "but it needn't be his lot. It's
for you to say. I can very well afford a small endowment
for research, if you say so."</p>

<p>"But why must <em>I</em> decide?"</p>

<p>"Because," he said, slowly, "I felt when I was
talking to you to-day that you hated everything
I said; you wanted to go on believing in all the
Shakespeare legends."</p>

<p>"I think I said so. I'm not sure that I meant
it. Anyhow, if it rests with me I say give him
his research endowment, if he'll take it."</p>

<p>"He'll take it. I'll get a man I know at Balliol
to write, offering it. In his beautiful transatlantic
simplicity the dear chap will think the
college is offering the money. He'll take it like
a lamb. But won't you tell me&mdash;why was it that
you hated me to be interested in this business
and you are glad that this Vandervelde should
be helped to go on with it?"</p>

<p>"I should like him to be happy," she said, "and
there's nothing else in life for him&mdash;he has given
up everything else for it. I want him, at least, to
have the treasure he's paid everything for&mdash;the
joy of his work. But that sort of joy should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
reserved for the people who can have nothing
else. But for you&mdash;well, somehow, I feel that
people who take up a thing like this ought to be
prepared to sacrifice everything else in life to it,
as he has done. And I could not bear that you
should do it. Life has so much besides for you."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "life holds very much for me."</p>

<p>"And for me, too," she said, and with that
gave him her hand for good night.</p>

<p>He was certain afterward that it had not been
his doing, and yet it must have been, for her hand
had not moved in his. And yet he had found it
laid not against his lips, but against his cheek,
and he had held it there in silence for more than a
moment before she drew it away and said good
night.</p>

<p>At the door she turned and looked back over
her shoulder. "Good night," she said again.
"Good night, Edward."</p>

<p>And that was the first time she called him by his
name.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>




<h2>XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KENILWORTH</div>


<div class='cap'>THERE are some very pleasant shops in Warwick,
and if you have time and no money you
can spend some very agreeable mornings wandering
from one shop to another, asking the prices of
things you have all the will but none of the
means to buy. If you have money and time you
will buy a few of the things whose prices you have
asked. Edward bought a ring, crystal with brilliants
around it, very lovely and very expensive,
and some topazes set in old silver, quite as beautiful
but not so dear.</div>

<p>Then they went to the old-furniture shops,
where he excited the vexed admiration of the
dealers by his unerring eye for fakes. He bought
an oak chest, carved with a shield of arms, the
date 1612, and the initials "I. B."</p>

<p>"If we were really married," he told her, "I
should be vandal enough to alter that 'I' to
make it stand for your name."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not think it a vandal's act&mdash;if we
were married," she answered, and their eyes met.
He bought tables and chairs of oak and beech; a
large French cupboard whose age, he said, made
it a fit mate for the chest; he bought a tall clock
with three tarnished gold pines atop, and some
brass pots and pewter plates. She strayed away
from him at the last shop, while he was treating
for a Welsh dresser with brass handles, and when
he had made his bargain he followed her, to find
her lovingly fingering chairs of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier-mâché</i>
painted with birds and flowers and inlaid with
mother-of-pearl. There was a table, too, graceful
and gay as the chairs, and a fire-screen of fine
needlework.</p>

<p>"You hate anything that isn't three or four
hundred years old," she said. "It's dreadful that
our tastes don't agree, isn't it? Don't you think
we ought to part at once? 'They separated on
account of incompatibility of furniture.'"</p>

<p>"But don't you like the things we have been
getting?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, but I like these, too. They're
like lavender and pot-pourri, and ladies who had
still-rooms and made scents and liqueurs and confections
in them, and walked in their gardens in
high-heeled shoes and peach-blossom petticoats."</p>

<p>"Why not buy them, then?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would if I had a house. If I were buying
things I should first buy everything I liked, and
not try to keep to any particular period. I believe
the things would all settle down and be
happy together if you loved them all. Did you
get your precious dresser? And are you going to
buy that Lowestoft dessert-service to go on it?"</p>

<p>He bought the Lowestoft dessert-service, beautiful
with red, red roses and golden tracery; and
next day he got up early and went around and
bought all the painted mother-of-pearly things
that she had touched. He gave the man an
address in Sussex to which to send everything,
and he wrote a long letter to his old nurse, whose
address it was that he had given.</p>

<p>They had had dinner in the little private sitting-room
over the front door, the smallest private
room, I believe, that ever took an even semi-public
part in the life of a hotel. It was quite
full of curly glass vases and photographs in frames
of silver and of plush, till Edward persuaded the
landlady to remove them, "for fear," as he said,
"we should have an accident and break any of
them."</p>

<p>They breakfasted here, and here, too, luncheon
was served, so that they met none of the other
guests at meals, and in their in-goings and out-comings
they only met strangers. Mr. Schultz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
might still have been at Tunbridge Wells, for any
sense they had of him.</p>

<p>Presently and inevitably came the afternoon
when they motored to Kenilworth.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to see Kenilworth," she
told him, "almost more than any place. Kenilworth
and the Pyramids and Stonehenge and the
Lost City in India&mdash;you know the one that the
very name of it is forgotten, and they just found
it by accident, all alone and beautiful, with panthers
in it instead of people, and trees growing
out of the roofs of the palaces, like Kipling's
Cold Lairs."</p>

<p>"I get a sort of cold comfort from the thought
of that city," he said. "That and Babylon and
Nineveh and the great cities in Egypt. When I
go through Manchester or New Cross or Sheffield
I think, 'Some day grass and trees will cover up
all this ugliness and flowers will grow again in the
Old Kent Road.'"</p>

<p>"It is cold comfort," she said. "I wish flowers
and grass could cover the ugliness, but I should
like them to be flowers planted by us living people&mdash;not
just wild flowers and the grass on graves."</p>

<p>The first sight of Kenilworth was naturally a
great shock to her, as it always is to those who
know of it only from books and photographs and
engravings.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear," she said, "how horrible! Why, it's
pink!"</p>

<p>It is, bright pink, and to eyes accustomed to
the dignified gray monochrome of our South
Country castles, Bodiam and Hever, Pevensey
and Arundel, Kenilworth at first seems like a bad
joke, or an engraving colored by a child who has
used up most of the paints in its paint-box and
has had to make shift with Indian red and vermilion,
the only two tints surviving. But when you
get nearer, when you get quite near, when you look
up at the great towers, when you walk between
the great masses of it, and see the tower that
Elizabeth's Leicester built, and the walls that
Cromwell's soldiers battered down, you forgive
Kenilworth for being pink, and even begin to
admit that pink is not such a bad color for castles.</p>

<p>At Kenilworth you talk, of course, about Queen
Elizabeth, and the one who has read the guide-books
tells the one who hasn't that when the
Queen visited Leicester he had a new bridge
built over his lake so that she might enter the
castle by a way untrodden by any previous guest.
Also that during her visit the clock bell rang not
a note and that the clock stood still withal, the
hands of it pointing ever to two o'clock, the hour
of banquet. Further, that during her visit of
seventeen days Kenilworth Castle managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
put away three hundred and twenty hogsheads of
beer.</p>

<p>"Those were great days," said Edward.</p>

<p>There are towers to climb at Kenilworth, as well
as towers to gaze at, and with that passion for
ascending steps which marks the young the two
made their way to the top of one tower after another.
It was as they leaned on the parapet of
the third and looked out over the green country
that Edward broke off in an unflattering anecdote
of my Lord of Leicester. He stiffened as a pointer
stiffens when it sees a partridge.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said, "look!"</p>

<p>Two fields away sheep were feeding&mdash;a moment
ago calm, white shapes dotting a pastoral landscape,
now roused to violent and unsuitable activities
by the presence among them of some
strange foe, some inspirer of the ungovernable
fear that can find relief only in flight. The scurrying
mass of them broke a little, and the two on the
tower saw the shape of terror. They heard it,
also. It was white and active. It barked.</p>

<p>"Oh, run," said she; "it <em>is</em> Charles. I'm almost
certain it is. Oh, run!" And he turned and ran
down the tower steps. She saw him come out
and cross the grassy square of the castle at fine
racing speed.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> Charles," she assured herself. "It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
be." Yet how could even that inspired dog have
escaped from the stable at Warwick where they
had left him, have followed their motor, and got
here so soon. She could not know that another
motor from the hotel, coming out to pick up a client,
had overtaken Charles laboring up the hill
from the top of which you get your first view of
the castle towers, and, recognizing the dog&mdash;as who
that had ever seen him could fail to do&mdash;had, so
to speak, offered him a lift. Charles had accepted,
and would have been handed over to his master's
chauffeur at the Castle Gate House but that, a
little short of that goal, as the car waited for a
traction engine to pass it in the narrow way,
Charles had seen the sheep, and with one bound of
desperate gallantry was out and after them before
his charioteer could even attempt restraint. And
now Charles was in full pursuit of the sheep,
barking happily in complete enjoyment of this
thrilling game, and Edward was in pursuit of
Charles, shouting as he ran. But Charles had no
mind to listen&mdash;one could always pretend afterward
that one had not heard, and no dog was more
skilful than Charles in counterfeiting unconsciousness,
nor in those acts of cajolery which soften
the hearts of masters. His surprised delight when
he should at last discover that his master was there
and desired his company would be acted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
life and would be enough to soften any heart. If
either had looked up and back he could have seen
a white speck on a red tower, which was Herself,
watching the chase. But neither of them did.
More observant and, to his own thinking, more
fortunate, was another visitor to the castle; he,
to be exact, whom what we may call Charles's
motor had come to Kenilworth to pick up.</p>

<p>He had seen the fleecy scurrying, heard the
yaps of pursuit, seen the flying form of Edward,
and entered sufficiently into the feelings of Charles
to be certain that the chase was not going to be
a short one. He now saw from the foot of Mervyn's
tower the white speck against blue sky. He
made his way straight to the tower where she
stood. She saw him crossing the grassy court
which Edward's flying feet had but just now
passed over. He came quickly and purposefully,
and he was Mr. Schultz&mdash;none other.</p>

<p>Now she was not afraid of Mr. Schultz. Why
should she be? He had been very kind, and of
course she was not ungrateful, but it was a shock
to see him there&mdash;a shock almost as great as that
given by the pinkness of Kenilworth, and, anyhow,
she did not want to meet him again; anyhow, not
to-day; anyhow, not on the top of a tower. And
it was quite plain to her that he had perceived
her presence, had recognized her, and was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
up expressly because of that&mdash;that his views were
not hers, that he did want to meet her again, did
want to meet her to-day, did want to meet her
on top of a tower&mdash;this tower.</p>

<p>She looked around her "like a hunted thing," as
they say, and then she remembered a very little
room, hardly more than a recess, opening from
the staircase. If she hurried down, hid there,
and stood very close to the wall, he would pass
by and not notice, and as he went up she could
creep down and out, and, keeping close to the
walls, get away toward Edward and Charles and
the sheep and all the things that do not make for
conversation with Mr. Schultz.</p>

<p>Lightly and swiftly as a hunted cat she fled
down the stairs on whose lower marches was the
sound of boots coming up toward her, echoing in
the narrow tower like the tramp of an armed man.
It came to her, as she reached the little room and
stood there, her white gown crushed against the
red stones, how a captive in just such a tower in
the old days she and Edward had been talking of
might have seized such a chance of escape from
real and horrible danger, might have hidden as
she was hiding, have held his breath as she now
held hers, and how his heart would have beat, even
as hers was beating, at the step of the guard coming
toward the hiding-place, passing it, going on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the tower-top while he, the fugitive, crept down
toward liberty and sunlight and the good green
world roofed with the good free sky.</p>

<p>The thought did not make for calmness. She
said afterward that the tower must have been
haunted by the very spirit of fear, for a panic
terror came over her, something deeper and fiercer
than anything Schultz could inspire&mdash;at any rate,
in this century&mdash;and a caution and care that such
as fear alone can teach. She slid from her hiding-place
and down the stair, and as she went she
heard above her those other steps, now returning.
Nothing in the world seemed so good as the
thought of the sunshine and free air into which
in another moment she would come out. Round
and round the spirals of the stone staircase went
her noiseless, flying feet; the sound of the feet
that followed came louder and quicker; a light
showed at the bottom of the stairs; she rounded
the last curve with a catch of the breath that was
almost a cry, and in her eyes the vision of the fair,
free outside world. She sprang toward green
grass and freedom and sunlight, and four dark
walls received her. For half-way down that
tower the steps divide and she had passed the
division and taken the stairs that led down past
the level of the earth. And the light that had
seemed to come through the doorway of the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
came through the high-set window of a dungeon,
and there was no way out save by the stairs on
which already she could hear feet descending.
The man who followed her had not missed the
way.</p>

<p>To turn back and meet that man on the stairs
was impossible. She stood at bay. And she knew
what the captive in old days must have felt&mdash;what
the rabbit feels when it is caught in the trap. She
stood rigid, with such an access of blind terror
that the sight of the man, when he came down the
last three steps, was almost&mdash;no, quite&mdash;relief. She
had not fled from him, but from something more
vague and more terrible. And when he spoke
fear left her altogether, and she asked herself,
"How could I have been so silly?"</p>

<p>"Miss Basingstoke?" He spoke on what he
meant for a note of astonishment and pleasure,
but his acting was not so good as hers, and he
had to supplement it by adding, "This is, indeed, a
delightful surprise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Schultz," she said, and quite gaily
and lightly, too&mdash;"how small the world is! Of all
unlikely places to meet any one one knows!" and
she made to pass him and go up the stairs. But
he stood square and firm at the stair-foot.</p>

<p>"No hurry," he said, "no hurry&mdash;since we <em>have</em>
met. It is a wonderful pleasure to me, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Basingstoke. Don't cut it short. And what have
you been doing all this long time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, traveling about," she answered, watching
the stair-foot as the rabbit from beside its burrow
might watch the exit at which a terrier is posted.
"Just seeing England, you know. We neglect
England too much, don't you think, rushing off
to the Riviera and Egypt and India and places
like that when all the while there are the most
beautiful things at home."</p>

<p>"I agree," he said, "the most beautiful things
are in England," and lest his meaning should escape
her, added, with a jerk of a bow, "and the
most beautiful people." And still he stood there,
smiling and not moving.</p>

<p>"Have you your car with you?" she asked, for
something to say.</p>

<p>"No, but I'll send for it if you like. We could
have some pleasant drives&mdash;Stratford, Shakespeare's
birthplace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've been to Stratford," she put in, and went
a step nearer to the stair-foot.</p>

<p>"Then anywhere you like. Shall I send for
the car?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Basingstoke," she said, quite untruly,
"doesn't care much about motoring."</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;? Oh, your brother! Well, we did very
well without him before, didn't we? Do you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
what a jolly drive we had, and a jolly
lunch; in point of fact, practically everything was
jolly until <em>he</em> turned up. I wished him far enough,
I can tell you, and I hope you did. Say you did."</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't," she had to say.</p>

<p>"Well, he'd no right to be stuffy if another
fellow took care of you when he couldn't be
bothered to."</p>

<p>"You know it wasn't that. You know it was
a mistake."</p>

<p>"I know a good deal," he said, "more than you
think for." And he smiled, trying to meet her
eyes.</p>

<p>"It's cold here," she found herself saying. "I
was just going up. I don't like dungeons. Do
you?"</p>

<p>"I like this one," said he. "Anywhere where
<em>you</em> are, don't you know&mdash;a palace and all that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I really must go," she said. "My brother
won't know where I am."</p>

<p>"No," he said, with meaning, "he won't."
And he set his two hands to the pillars of the arch
under which he stood and swayed to and fro,
looking at her.</p>

<p>"I must really go. Will you let me pass, Mr.
Schultz, please."</p>

<p>"Not till you tell me to send for my car. I've
set my heart on those drives with you. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
brother can stay behind if he doesn't care for
motoring. <em>I</em> don't want him, and I'll take care
<em>you</em> don't miss him."</p>

<p>"Do, please," she said, "let me pass."</p>

<p>"No," said he. "I've got you and I mean to
keep you. Your brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's not my brother," she said, on a sudden
resolution. "We told you that because, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother to explain," he said, smiling.
That smile, in the days when that dungeon <em>was</em> a
dungeon, might have cost him his life if the lady
before him had had a knife and the skill to use it.
Even now it was to cost him something.</p>

<p>"He's not my brother&mdash;we're married," she
said. And at that he laughed.</p>

<p>"I know, my dear girl," he said. "I know all
about it. But marriages like that don't last forever,
and they don't prevent another gentleman
playing for his own hand. I was there when he
wasn't, and you let me help you."</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't," said she. "I wish I'd
walked all the way to London first. I didn't
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't think I'd got the sense to put two
and two together," said he; "but I have. Come,
look here. I liked your looks from the first. I
thought&mdash; Never mind about that, though. I
was wrong. But even now I like you better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
than any girl I've ever come across. Now, look
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say any more," she urged, almost wildly.
"Don't! I am married. You don't believe me,
but I am. You were kind once; be kind now and
let me go&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was like a prisoner imploring a jailer.</p>

<p>"Let you go?" he echoed. "I know better.
Not till you say, 'Send for the motor,' and that
you'll go out in it with me. Say that and you're
free as air."</p>

<p>And she might have said it, for the terror that
lurked in that tower was coming back, in a new
dress, but the same terror. But he went on,
"Come, say it, and seal the bargain prettily."</p>

<p>And then she said, "If you don't let me pass
I swear I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>What the threat would have been she hardly
knew, and he never knew, for he took a step
toward her with his hands outstretched, and words
seemed at once to become weak and silly. She
clutched her rosy sunshade at about half its length
and struck full at his head. The sunshade broke.
He put his hands to his temples and held them
a moment.</p>

<p>"Now, by God," he said, "after that&mdash;" and
came toward her.</p>

<p>And even as he moved the feet of the deliverer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
sounded on the stairs. Hurried feet, spurning
the stones, feet swifter than a man's, lighter
than a woman's&mdash;little feet that gave out a thin,
quick sound not like the sound of human footsteps.
She called aloud on the name of the deliverer
and he came, swift as the arrow from the
bow of a master-archer.</p>

<p>"Charles!" she cried. "Charles, seize him! Hold
him!"</p>

<p>And Charles, coming headlong into that dark
place like a shaft of live white light, seized him,
and held, by the leg.</p>

<p>Mr. Schultz did his best to defend himself, but
he had no stick, and no blows of the human fist confused
or troubled that white bullet head, no curses
affected it, and against those white teeth no kicks
or struggles availed.</p>

<p>"Hold him! hold him!" she cried, the joy of
vicarious battle lighting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" said Schultz. "Call the devil
off."</p>

<p>"I will," said she, "from the top of the stairs.
And I'll leave you this for comfort: If you behave
yourself for the future I won't tell my husband
about this. He'd half kill you."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Schultz, even
with Charles's teeth quietly but persistently boring
his leg. "I don't know so much about that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do," she said, with almost the conviction of
the woman in love. "You'd better stay here till
we've gone away. I'm not ungrateful for what
you did for me on that day, and if you never dare
to speak to me again I'll never tell."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you tell," said Schultz.
"Call the devil off, I say."</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs, and at the top called out,
"Charles, drop it. Come here, sir."</p>

<p>And Charles dropped it and came.</p>

<p>It was then for the first time that she felt that
she was Charles's mistress, even as Edward was
Charles's master.</p>

<p>The dog and the woman went out together into
the sunshine, and there, between blue sky and
green grass, embraced with all the emotions proper
to deliverer and delivered. When Edward rejoined
them, five minutes later, she was able to say,
quite calmly:</p>

<p>"Yes, he found me out. He <em>is</em> clever. He is a
darling."</p>

<p>"He deserves a jolly good hiding," said Edward,
"and I've a jolly good mind to give it to
him."</p>

<p>"Let him off this time," she said, "it was so
clever of him to find me out. He hadn't hurt
any of the sheep, had he?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, "but he might have."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, if we come to might-have-beens," said she,
"I might not be here, he might not be here. We
all might not be here. Think of that. No, don't
look at him with that 'wait-till-I-get-you-home'
expression. Forgive him and be done with it."</p>

<p>And when she looked at him like that, as he
told himself, what could he do but forgive the
dog?</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "of course I'll forgive him!"
adding, with one of those diabolical flashes of
insight to which our subconscious selves are sometimes
liable. "Why, I'd forgive Schultz himself
if you asked me like that."</p>

<p>"It isn't Mr. Schultz I want you to forgive,"
she said, "it's Charles&mdash;Charles that I love."</p>

<p>"Not Schultz whom you like."</p>

<p>"I hate Schultz," said she, so vehemently that
he wondered. Because always before she had defended
the man and called him kind and helpful.
It was, however, so pleasant to him that she
should hate Schultz that he put his wonder by
to taste that pleasure.</p>

<p>She had the self-control to wait till they were
gliding through the streets of Warwick before she
said, "Do you want to stay here any longer?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't," said he.</p>

<p>"I should like to go to Chester," she said, "now&mdash;this
evening. Would you mind? There's such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
lots to see, and something might happen at any
moment to stop our&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our incredible honeymoon?" he said. "But
what could?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Alice might be ill and want me"&mdash;and
hated herself for the words. The moment she
had uttered them she felt that in using her as a
defense she had almost as good as called down the
wrath of the gods on Aunt Alice, whom she loved.
"Oh, a thousand things might happen," she
added, quickly.</p>

<p>"My lady's will is my law," said Edward, and
within an hour or two they were on the way to
Chester. Charles did not, this time, make his
journey in the dog-box. She smiled on the guard,
and Charles traveled in a first-class carriage with
his master and his mistress. He sat between them
and was happy as only they can be happy who
have combined duty and pleasure. He had
chased sheep&mdash;this was obviously not wrong, since
master had not punished him for it. He had bitten
a stranger at mistress's bidding. Mistress was
evidently one who sympathized with the natural
aspirations of right-minded dogs. Charles knew
now how much he loved her. He leaned himself
against her, heavily asleep, now and then growling
softly as he slept. His mistress felt that in his
dreams he was still biting Mr. Schultz. He was.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CAERNARVON</div>


<div class='cap'>SOMEHOW or other Chester failed to charm.
Neither of them could understand why. Perhaps
the Stratford Hotel had given them a momentary
surfeit of half-timber; perhaps the fact
that the skies turned gray and substituted drizzle
for sunshine had something to do with it; perhaps
it was the extreme badness of the hotel to which
ill-luck led them, a hotel that smelt of stale seed-cake
and bad coffee and bad mutton-fat, and was
furnished almost entirely with bentwood chairs
and wicker tables; perhaps it was the added aggravation
of seeing a river which might have been
to them a second Medway, and seeing it quite
impossible and miserably pitted with little rain-spots.
Whatever the reason, even next morning's
sunshine and the beauty of the old walls and the
old walks failed to dispel the gloom. They bought
rain-coats and umbrellas in a shop that had known
ruffs and farthingales, paid their hotel bill, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
was as large as the hotel was bad, and took the
afternoon train to Caernarvon.</div>

<p>The glimpse of Conway Castle from the train
cheered them a little. The sight of the sea did
more&mdash;but still he felt a cloud between them, and
still she felt more and more that he was aware of
it. Charles sat between them, as before, and over
that stout white back his eyes met hers.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, suddenly. "Yesterday
I thought it was the half-timber and the rain&mdash;this
morning I thought it was yesterday, but it
isn't. Something's happened that you haven't
told me."</p>

<p>She turned her eyes from his and stroked the
flappy white ears of Charles.</p>

<p>"Hasn't it?" he urged. "Ah, you will tell me,
won't you? Was it something from the aunts?"</p>

<p>For there had been letters that morning, sent
on from Warwick.</p>

<p>"No, the letters were all right. Everybody's
furious except Aunt Alice, but she's the only one
that matters."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's almost gone," she said. "Oh, look at the
rocks and the heather on that great hill."</p>

<p>"Then there was something," he said; "something
you won't tell me."</p>

<p>"Not won't," she said, gently.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't? Something that's happened and you
can't tell me?"</p>

<p>He remembered how on the last night at Warwick
he had held that hand of hers against his
face. They had seemed so very near then. And
now there was a gulf suddenly opened between
them&mdash;the impassable gulf of a secret&mdash;a secret
that was hers and not his.</p>

<p>"Yes, something did happen and I have promised
not to tell you. If ever I can, I will."</p>

<p>"Something has come between us and you have
promised not to tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;no!" she said, very earnestly, and her
dear eyes looked full in his. "Nothing has come
between us&mdash;nothing could&mdash;"</p>

<p>He realized, with some impatience, that Charles,
at least, was between them. But for Charles he
could, quite naturally and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ayant l'air de rien</i> have
leaned a little toward her as he spoke&mdash;so that his
shoulder might, perhaps, if she had leaned also,
have just touched hers. But across Charles this
could not be. And to lean, after the removal of
Charles, would bear an air of premeditation not to
be contemplated for an instant.</p>

<p>"If it's nothing that comes between us&mdash;" he
said. "But even then, it's something that's made
you sad, made you different. I suppose, though,
it's unreasonable to expect that there shall be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
secrets between any two human beings, no matter
how&mdash;how friendly they are," he ended, with
conscious lameness.</p>

<p>"Of course it's unreasonable," she said; "it
would mean, wouldn't it, that neither of us could
ever be trusted by any one else? Whereas now
people can tell you things they wouldn't want to
tell me, and tell me things they wouldn't care
about telling you."</p>

<p>"Then this&mdash;I'm not worrying you to tell me&mdash;but
if it is somebody else's secret&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it is," she said. "Now, are you satisfied?
And if you'll only let me look at the sea and the
mountains and the heather the Chester cloud will
go right away. It's nearly gone now. And I've
never seen any real mountains before, not mountains
like these, with warm colors and soft shapes&mdash;only
the Pyrenees and the Maritime Alps, and
they look just like white cardboard cut into
points and pasted on blue sugar-paper&mdash;that's
the sky."</p>

<p>"It's prettier at sunrise, with the mountains
like pink and white sugar, and Corsica showing
like a little cloud over the sea. We had a villa
at Antibes when I was a little chap, before we
lost our money. We'll go there again some day,
shall we, and see if the mountains have changed
at all? Not this winter, I think. I've never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
an English winter free from work I didn't like. I
must have just this one. You don't mind?"</p>

<p>What he hoped she wouldn't mind was less the
English winter than his calm assumption that there
was plenty of time, that they would always be together
and might go where they would and when&mdash;since
all the future was before them&mdash;all the future,
and each other's companionship all through it.</p>

<p>"Why should I mind?" she answered. "I've
never had a free winter in England, either, or
anywhere else, for that matter."</p>

<p>"Then that's settled," said he, comfortably,
"and you can't think what a comfort it is to me
that you don't hate Charles. You might so easily
have hated dogs."</p>

<p>"If I'd been that sort of person I shouldn't be
here."</p>

<p>"Ah, but Charles might so easily have been the
one kind of dog you couldn't stand. He's not
everybody's dog, by any means. Are you, Charles?
Of course it's almost incredible that this earth
should contain people who don't like Charles, yet
so it is."</p>

<p>"The people he's bitten?"</p>

<p>"Oh, those!" said Edward, adding, with a fine
air of tolerance, "I could almost find excuses for
them&mdash;they've not seen the finer aspects of his
character. No, there are actually human beings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
whom Charles's personality does not appeal&mdash;persons
whom he has borne with patiently, whom
he has refrained from biting, or even sniffing at
the trousers legs of. Prejudice is a mysterious and
terrible thing. Oh, but it's a good world&mdash;all the
same."</p>

<p>"Isn't it," she said, "with the sun shining and
the mountains and the rocks and the sea all there,
just like a picture? Oh, there's no doubt but it's
a beautiful world."</p>

<p>"And you and I and Charles going out to see
it all together. It's a fine world, every bit of it&mdash;and
the little bit we're just coming to is Caernarvon."</p>

<p>Caernarvon it was, and they spent nearly a week
there. The castle is all that a castle should be;
and as for the sea, what can be better, unless it's
in Cornwall; and there is Anglesea, lying flat
against the sky, and the Elephant Mountain and
the Seven Sisters, and old Snowdon topping all.</p>

<p>The inn was comfortable, the weather had
grown kind again, the hostler was one of those
to whom Charles's personality so much appealed
that the dog was almost too replete with good
living to appreciate the rats provided for his recreation.
This hostler, Owen Llewellyn, became
such an enthusiast in the service of Charles that
Mr. Basingstoke was only able by a fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
chance, the strong exercise of authority, and a
golden offering for the soothing of wounded feelings
to stop the entertainment which Owen had
arranged with several of his friends in a handy field
and the cool of the evening: a quiet little dog-fight,
as the friends indignantly explained, with
Charles and a worthy antagonist filling the leading
rôles.</p>

<p>"It isn't as if the dogs wouldn't enjoy it more
than any one else, and me putting all my money
on your dog, sir," one of the friends (from London)
complained. "There ain't nothing that that
there dog 'u'd love better nor a bit of a scrap. An'
you to go agin the animal's natural desires and
keep him for a lap-dog for the lady. It ain't
right," he ended, feelingly, as the lap-dog was
led off, yapping defiance at the adversary whom,
so his admirers swore, he could have licked hollow
with one paw tied behind him.</p>

<p>It was at Caernarvon that Edward and his
princess lived the quiet life that does not lead
to sight-seeing. There was something poignantly
domestic to his mind in those long mornings in
green fields or among the broken and still beautiful
colonnades of the castle, he with a book from
which he read to her, she with some work of embroidery
in which a bright needle flashed among
pleasant-colored silks. It was in the castle, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
one of those mysterious narrow passages, that they
came face to face with a tall, handsome man of
middle age, who shook Edward's hand with extreme
vigor, clapped him on the back, and announced
that he would have run a mile for the
sake of seeing him. Edward would have run two
to avoid the meeting, because the eyes of the back-clapper
were turned on Katherine, awaiting the
introduction which must come. Colonel Bertram,
an old friend of Edward's father's, knew well enough
that Edward was an only child. No brother-and-sister
tale was possible here.</p>

<p>"Do you hang out in these parts?" Edward
asked. "I wonder you knew me. I don't believe
we've met since I was about sixteen."</p>

<p>While he spoke he looked a question at her, and
read the slightest possible sign with which she
answered.</p>

<p>"Colonel Bertram&mdash;my wife. Katherine, the
Colonel used to tip me sovereigns when I was at
school, and he gave me my first pony."</p>

<p>The colonel's grip ground her rings into her
hand. "'Pon my word!" he said, "I don't know
when I've been so pleased. You must come and
dine with us, my boy, to-night&mdash; To-morrow?
Make him come, Mrs. Basingstoke. I know it's
not manners to intrude on a honeymoon, but I am
such an old friend, and our meeting like this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
such a remarkable coincidence, almost like the
finger of Providence&mdash;upon my soul it is."</p>

<p>"It's very, very nice of you to ask us," she said,
in a voice of honey, "but, unfortunately, we're
leaving this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, let's lunch together. No,
of course; too late for that. Well, look here,
you've seen the castle, of course; come and see
over the prison. I'm governor there, for my sins.
Come and let me show you my prison!"</p>

<p>His simple pride in the only sight he had to
show prevailed even against the shrinking she felt
and did not wholly understand.</p>

<p>"When are you leaving? The six o'clock train?
Plenty of time. We've made wonderful reforms,
I can tell you. The cells are pictures, perfect pictures.
'Pon my word, I never was so glad to see
any one. And so you're married. Dear, dear,
dear! Makes me feel an old boy, that it does!
The young ones growing up around us&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>He led the way out of the castle, and Edward
and Katherine exchanged behind his cordial back
glances almost of despair. They had not wanted
to leave Caernarvon, but Edward could only bless
Katherine for her decision. The relations of Mr.
and Mrs. Basingstoke could never have stood the
affectionate cross-questionings of Mrs. Bertram.
They must go; Katherine was right.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine, meantime, was wishing she had invented
a headache, an appointment at the local
dentist's, had even simulated a swoon at Colonel
Bertram's feet, before she had consented to visit
a prison.</p>

<p>From the first moment of her entrance there
the prison appalled her. It was a very nice prison,
as prisons go. But the grating at the door, the
locks that clicked, the polished keys, the polished
handcuffs, the prison records which their host exhibited
with so much ingenuous enthusiasm; the
cells, one little cage after another in which human
birds were pent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"What have they all done?" she asked, as they
walked along a stone-paved gallery; and wished
she had not asked, for the details of horrible
crimes were the last things she wished to hear.</p>

<p>"Oh, petty felonies, mostly," said the governor,
airily.</p>

<p>It seemed more and more horrible to her that
she and he and the governor should tread the
mazes of this place free to come and go as they
chose, while these other human beings, for whatever
fault&mdash;and it seemed the faults could hardly
rank as crimes&mdash;should be here encaged, never
more to go out free till their penance should have
purged them.</p>

<p>"I suppose one mustn't give them anything?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little good advice wouldn't be amiss. 'Don't
do it any more,' and so on. Would you like to
give them an address, Mrs. Basingstoke?"</p>

<p>She hated his badinage. "I mean tobacco or
chocolate or books, or anything that they'd <em>like</em>,"
she explained, patiently.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the governor. "They aren't
pets, you know. Mustn't feed them through the
bars as though they were rabbits or guinea-pigs.
The townspeople <em>will</em> throw tobacco over into the
yard. Can't stop them. But of course we punish
the offenders very severely whenever we manage
to bring it home to them."</p>

<p>The horrible sense of slavery grew on her&mdash;the
prisoners were slaves to the warders, the warders
slaves, and super-subservient slaves, to the governor,
the governor himself a slave to some power
unseen but all-potent.</p>

<p>She watched her opportunity and while Colonel
Bertram was explaining to Edward the method of
the manufacture of post-office bags she opened her
purse in her pocket and let all its contents fall
loose, therein. Then she gathered the money in a
handful, careful that no rattle or chink should
betray her, and when the governor was explaining
how wire netting, spread over each gallery to catch
any object thrown from above rendered suicide
difficult, if not impossible, she knotted the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in her handkerchief. Then she watched for
further opportunity, hoping against hope, for it
seemed that her chance would never come. There
were eyes everywhere.</p>

<p>"If I can't do it here, I'll buy tobacco and throw
it over the wall," she told herself.</p>

<p>It was in the kitchen that the chance came.
Three prisoners were there acting as cooks, and
the governor had sent the attendant warder on
some errand, to order tea for them in his office, as
events showed.</p>

<p>"Very nice&mdash;very neat&mdash;very clean." She
praised all in the simplest and most direct words.</p>

<p>The governor again addressed himself to Edward.
It was a tale of poaching that he told&mdash;the
theft of two hares and a pheasant&mdash;a desperate
crime duly punished. He and Edward left the
kitchen, talking. She followed, but first she laid
her hand on a table near the door and looked full
at the nearest prisoner. Then she smiled. The
three smiled back at her. Then she opened her
hand, showing plainly the knotted handkerchief.
"Good luck!" she said, low, but so that they all
heard her.</p>

<p>Then she followed the governor and Edward,
but at the door she turned and kissed her hand to
the three prisoners. The faces they turned to her
will stay with her as long as she lives. Wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
delight, incredulity&mdash;that any one&mdash;that <em>she</em> should
have cared to say "good luck," should have smiled
at them, should have left them her handkerchief,
though they did not yet know what was in it. The
wonder and worship in their eyes brought tears to
her own.</p>

<p>They were still there when the governor turned.</p>

<p>"A cup of tea, now, Mrs. Basingstoke," he said,
"it's all ready."</p>

<p>She answered hurriedly, "It's very kind of you,
but, do you know, if you don't mind, I think we
ought to be going. We've got to pack and all
that."</p>

<p>Colonel Bertram, who was no fool, heard the
quivering voice and saw the swimming eyes.
"So sorry," he said, "but charmed to have met
you&mdash;charmed," and stood back for her to pass
the door of the corridor. "<em>I</em> understand," he said;
"your wife's a bit upset. Ladies often are; they
don't understand the law, you know, the great
principles of property and the law. Don't mention
it; I like them soft-hearted. You're a fortunate
man, my boy&mdash;deuced fortunate. Good-by.
So very, very pleased we happened to meet.
Good-by."</p>

<p>The well-oiled locks clicked to let them out. In
the street she caught his arm and clung to it.</p>

<p>"There, there!" he spoke as one speaks to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
frightened child. "It's all over; don't distress
yourself."</p>

<p>"It's not all over for them," she said.</p>

<p>"Prisons have to be," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Have they?" said she. "I suppose they do,
but such little things. To take a pair of boots
because your feet are cold and you have no money,
and to pay for what you've done&mdash;with <em>that</em>.
Horrible! horrible!"</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke again till they were
nearly at the hotel. Then he said, "What did you
give them?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw you knotting something in that little
scented handkerchief of yours. What was it you
gave them."</p>

<p>"Every penny I had. And I said, 'Good luck
to you,' and I kissed my hand to them. There!"
she said, defiantly.</p>

<p>"It was like you," he said, and took her arm.
"But I wish I hadn't let you go inside the place.
I didn't realize how it would be to you. I didn't
realize what it would be to me."</p>

<p>"It was silly of me, I suppose," she said.</p>

<p>"I dare say. But you were lucky; I only managed
to drop my tobacco-pouch among the post-office bags,
but our guilt is equal. The sooner we
get out of Caernarvon the better. By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
don't let's catch the six-o'clock train to nowhere in
particular. Let's take a carriage and drive to
Llanberis and see the slate-quarries and go up
Snowdon."</p>

<p>"Don't let's ever go into another prison," she
said, blinking so that the tears should drop off
her eyelashes and not run down her face, "it
hurts so horribly, and we can't do any good."</p>

<p>"Not do any good?" he said. "Do you suppose
that life can ever be the same to a man to whom
you've smiled and kissed your hand? Ah, I don't
mean it for empty gallantry, my dear. I mean
that to know that you, free and beautiful, care
for them in their misery and imprisonment&mdash;don't
you think that's worth something?"</p>

<p>"If it is, I'm glad we went," said she.</p>

<p>Their departure for Llanberis, though sudden,
was the less deplored by the hotel management
because of a regrettable misunderstanding which
had arisen during the afternoon between Charles
and the house cat.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LLANBERIS</div>


<div class='cap'>LLANBERIS, prim and small, and very, very
Welsh, lies in the shadow of great Snowdon,
and all about it the lesser and more gracious
mountains&mdash;the mountains of green and purple and
brown&mdash;stand with their heads against the sky,
bathing their feet in great lakes of smooth, brown
water. The inn has a beautiful and terraced garden;
the stream from the waterfall under Snowdon
runs tumbling and gurgling down its rocky bed.
"The peace that is upon the lonely hills" may be
yours at the cost of a little breathless, happy
climbing; the deeper peace of valleys and lake
may be yours for no more trouble than it takes to
walk a couple of hundred yards from the door of
your inn. That the hotel was full did not seem
to matter&mdash;the other guests were off early, in
breaks and wagonettes, spending the long days
in excursions from which they returned late and
hilarious, breaking the soft night quiet with loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
laughter and snatches of the kind of songs that
nowadays delight the great heart of the people.
Trippers from Manchester and Liverpool came for
the day, but never strayed far from the inn, or, if
they did, went up Snowdon by the tiny railway.
Everywhere, save on the way that led to Snowdon,
you were sure of quiet or peace, of a world where
two could be alone together.</div>

<p>Here the two tried to take up again the life of
ordered ease that had been theirs at Caernarvon,
the little life they had prized and cherished till
the governor of Caernarvon prison had thrown a
stone into their magic pool, shattering all its mirrored
beauty. They spent long mornings on the
hillside, cushioned by the heather; long evenings
by the lakeside, always careful to choose their
resting-place so that they need not see the scars
where the waste slate is tipped into the lake,
slowly overlaying the green and graceful margin
with which Nature, if you let her alone, frames all
water mirrors. And once they went as far as the
mysterious Round Tower, which stands alone,
with no entrance but the doorway high above
your head.</p>

<p>"What a place to keep your enemy in," he said,
"or your friend! Suppose the tower had been my
stronghold, in the old days. I could have brought
my princess here, and snapped my fingers at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
relations drawn round the tower in a ring, shaking
their fists at me from their coal-black steeds, and
vowing vengeance when the tower should yield&mdash;which,
of course, it never would."</p>

<p>"Your princess would have starved," she said,
"and you with her."</p>

<p>"Not at all," he assured her; "you underrate the
resources of round towers. To say nothing of the
goats and sheep which we should drive in and
lower to the basement when our scout brought
news that your kinsmen were sending out the
fiery cross or the blood eagle, or whatever it was
that they did send out; and there's an inexhaustible
well inside the tower, and of course we should
have sacks of meal and casks of mead."</p>

<p>"But the enemy&mdash;her relations, I mean&mdash;would
have all the sheep on the mountains and all the
flour in the mills. You'd have to give in, in the
end."</p>

<p>"You forget the underground passage. When
we were tired of mocking your uncles and cousins
through the arrow-slits of our tower we'd quietly
creep away to our great castle&mdash;it's at Caernarvon,
you know&mdash;and call together all my uncles and
cousins and sally out and have a great battle, and
the sound of our blows on their helmets would be
heard on the far side of Anglesea, and down to the
very southernmost marches of Merioneth."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"But suppose her relations won the battle and
shut you up in a dungeon and put her into a
convent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they wouldn't. All our armor would be so
perfectly tempered that nobody would be hurt.
It would be like a tournament, and at the end, just
as your senior uncle and I had unhorsed each
other and were about to perish, mutually cloven
to the chine, you would rush between us&mdash;in
white, with your hair flowing like a thunder-cloud
behind you&mdash;and say to each of us, 'Spare him
for my sake.' And of course we should. And then
there would be a banquet in the great hall at
Caernarvon and clean rushes on the floor, and you
and I and all our relations sitting in state on the
dais, and you'd be wearing your gown of cloth
of gold and your cloak of vair, and all your jewels&mdash;and
I should have my furred gown and my great
ring, and we should drink out of the big silver
drinking-bowl&mdash;mead and strong ale&mdash;and feast
our guests and their men-at-arms and all our own
people on roast boars' heads and barons of beef,
and all live happily ever afterward."</p>

<p>"I don't think she'd wear her ermine mantle.
Wouldn't she wear the one of woven red, with
your coat of arms embroidered on it, and the gold
beads you brought her from the East when you
went to the wars there?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you would," he conceded. "I believe
I could climb up to that doorway. I should
like to&mdash;just to be sure there's really a well inside."</p>

<p>"No, don't," said she, "because you might find
out that there wasn't; or that this isn't really the
tower that has the underground passage leading
to Caernarvon, and then we should know that
we're not really remembering that other life when
you carried her off, but only making it up."</p>

<p>"Of course we remember it. Do you remember
whether you were angry with me for carrying you
off."</p>

<p>"If she hadn't wanted to be carried off," she
said, demurely, "she wouldn't have been. Or if
she hadn't been able to help herself she'd have
found a little knife, like the brown bride, or else
something to put in your mead-cup, so that the
first draught you had from her hand would have
been the last. She wasn't the sort of woman to
be taken against her will. Come away before you
spoil the story with any more questions. I liked
it best when we took the tale for granted&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was high up among the heather, with Charles
safely tethered and the steep hillside dotted with
hundreds and hundreds of sheep, that the talk grew
earnest and dwelt not on dreams of old days, but
the desire of new ones.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he said, "what you told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
me when we were going to Warwick?" He spoke
as though this had been a long time ago, as, indeed,
by any count but time it was. "You remember
about the scattered farms, and the way
the little houses call to you to come home."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"All that you said about the life&mdash;it was like
my other self speaking."</p>

<p>"You mean that when I spoke, your inside
self said, 'Yes, yes; that's what I mean'?"</p>

<p>"I mean more than that. My inside self said,
'Yes, yes, that's what I always meant. That's
what I meant and what I wanted before ever I
met you.' Then meeting you obscured everything
else, but when you spoke I saw that what
I had always wanted rhymed with what you had
always wanted. But I want to be quite sure.
May I ask questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Suppose we had been really married&mdash;would
you have been contented to spend your working
life on a farm, to live just that life that you spoke
of that day going to Warwick?"</p>

<p>She did not speak for a moment, and for a moment
he wished that he had not questioned. And
when she did speak it was not to give him an
answer.</p>

<p>"I didn't believe it was possible," she said. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thought people couldn't make farming succeed,
nowadays, and I don't think I could bear to spend
my working life, as you call it, on a thing that is
foredoomed to failure."</p>

<p>"Nor could I; and I don't mean to, either. My
farm will succeed. If it costs me every penny I
have it shall succeed. I shall go a new way to
work. You know I've really got quite a lot of
money, and I have a plan."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"It's quite simple, and absolutely opposed to
all the accursed teachings of political economy.
Of course I shall get the best machinery and the
best seeds and the best implements. But I shall
also get the best labor."</p>

<p>"Doesn't every one try to do that?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, every farmer tries to get the best
labor he can, at current rates. I sha'n't bother
about the current rates. I shall get the best men
that are to be got and I shall pay them wages that
will make them glad to come to me rather than
to any one else. If I find a man's good I shall give
him a share in the profits of the farm; if I find he
isn't any good I shall sack him."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, "whether you'd have the
heart to sack any one?"</p>

<p>"I might hesitate to sack a mere fool," he admitted.
"I might be tempted to keep him on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
find some work for him that even a fool could do.
But I'd chuck a slacker at a week's notice and
never turn a hair. You'll see; I shall have failures,
many of them, but the whole thing won't be
a failure. Before I've done I shall have the best
carters, the best dairy-women, the best bailiff, and
the best plowman and the most successful farm
in the country. You don't know how men can
work who are working for themselves and not just
for a master."</p>

<p>"You mean to make it a sort of communal
farm?"</p>

<p>"Never," he said. "That's the last thing I
mean it to be. But it will be a profit-sharing
farm, and I shall run it. It's my own idea, the
darling of my soul, and I won't trust its life to
any other man. I'm almost afraid to trust it to
you, for fear you should not be kind to it. But
if what you said on the way to Warwick meant
something that lasts in you&mdash;not just the beautiful
thoughts of the moment&mdash;tell me, if we
were really married could you endure a life like
that?"</p>

<p>"I should know nothing about it; I should be
of no use. And we're not married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You could learn; we could both learn. Let's
pretend for a moment that we're really going to
spend our lives together, anyhow. Let's leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Mrs. Basingstoke out of it. Would Miss Basingstoke
have been able to endure such a life?"</p>

<p>"Miss Basingstoke would have loved it," she
said. "Miss Basingstoke would have done her
best to learn, and&mdash;she isn't really stupid, you
know&mdash;I think Miss Basingstoke would have
succeeded."</p>

<p>"It would need patience," he said, "patience
and bravery and loving-kindness and gentleness
and firmness and unselfishness."</p>

<p>"And curiosity," she said. "That quality, at
least, Miss Basingstoke has. She would have
wanted to know all about everything, and that's
one way of learning. She wants, now, to know
ever so much more. Tell her everything that
you've thought of about it, everything you've decided
or not decided."</p>

<p>"You'll be kind to my darling dream, then,"
he said. "Well, here goes."</p>

<p>And with that he told her, and she listened and
questioned, and he answered again till the shadows
had grown heavy in the valley and they were very
late indeed for dinner.</p>

<p>You cannot be long in Llanberis without wanting
to "see over" a slate-quarry. It was on their
fifth day that the desire came to these two. The
mention of Colonel Bertram's name gained for
them a personally conducted tour through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
rows of little slate-roofed sheds where skilled workmen
strip and chip and shape the flakes of quarried
slate till they are the size and form needed for
roofing cottages and schools and Nonconformist
chapels. Having seen how the slate is treated in
the sheds, they were taken into the quarry itself
to see how the slate is got.</p>

<p>A big slate-quarry is a very impressive sight.
You walk across a great amphitheater whose walls
of slate rise high above you, their green-trimmed
edges sharply cut against the sky. You pick your
way among pools of water so smooth, so clear, that
they reflect like mirrors the blue sky and the high
slate walls of the quarry. One such pool&mdash;the
largest&mdash;lay in the middle of the vast amphitheater,
and in it the towering cliffs of slate were
reflected even more clearly than in the others.</p>

<p>"I never saw such reflections," she was saying,
as they skirted the big pond. "They're almost
more real than the real thing. I am glad we came
here; it's all so clear and bright and new-looking.
I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't walk quite so near the edge, if I
was you, sir," said the foreman, who was their
guide.</p>

<p>"Why?" Edward asked, gazing at the reflection
of high cliffs in the pool at his side, "is the water
deep&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>And even as he spoke his eyes were opened;
but before he could obey their mandate, with a
cry that went to his heart and held it she caught
his arm and pulled him back. For in that instant
she, too, had seen that this pool which reflected
so perfectly the tall precipices of the quarry was
not a pool at all, but another deep quarry within
the first, and that what it held was no reflection,
but a sheer and dreadful depth of precipice going
down&mdash;she would not look to see how far. And
he had been walking within six inches of its brink,
carelessly and at ease, as one does walk by the
safely shelving edge of any pond.</p>

<p>She did not let his arm go when she had drawn
him away from that perilous edge; she held it
closely pressed against her side, and when he
looked at her he saw that her face was white and
changed. The great precipice above them swayed
a little to her eyes&mdash;she dared not look at the
precipice below. She held his arm closely and
more closely, folding both hands on it. The foreman
was saying something. Neither of them heard
what it was, only both caught the concluding words:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to see the place, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Edward, mechanically, "and
then I think we must leave you. It's been most
kind of you to show us all this; we've been most
interested."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Her heart was beating in so wild an ecstasy of
thanksgiving for an unspeakable horror escaped,
his heart was beating in so passionate and proud
and humble a recognition of what her touch on his
arm confessed, that neither of them heard the
foreman's words or guessed at the meaning of
what he was calmly and coldly telling them. Only
afterward the memory of his words came back,
bringing with it understanding. They were led
across a flat wilderness of splintered slate toward
the tall cliff from which now and then came the
noise like thunder which blasting-powder makes
when it does its work. They two, hardly conscious
of anything but that they held each other&mdash;the
one who had been in danger, safe; the other
passionately grateful for that other's safety; and
the endangered one, passionately sensible of her
passionate gratitude, heard not a word that the
foreman spoke, though he spoke all the time.</p>

<p>"You are here; I hold you safe; but, oh, if I
had lost you!" her heart was singing to a breathless,
syncopated measure.</p>

<p>"You cared; you cared as much as this. If I
had fallen over that perilous edge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, but
you care, you care! It is as much as this to you,"
his heart sang, keeping time to hers.</p>

<p>It was a trance of mutual meeting emotion
such as they had not yet known. In that one moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
when he walked the narrow edge of that
precipice and when she had seen the precipice for
the horror it was, she learned more than in all
her life before. And he, in the moments that followed,
knew, beyond possibility of mistake or misunderstanding,
what it was that she had learned.
If only they could have walked straight out of
that quarry into the world of stream and mountain,
the world where you are only two&mdash;but the
foreman was there, walking and talking, and at
last stopping and saying:</p>

<p>"This is where it happened."</p>

<p>And they came out of their dream to find themselves
close to the slate cliff at whose base lay
great blocks of slate newly fallen, and to see the
flat slate flakes at their feet, brown and wet.</p>

<p>"Where what happened?" Edward asked,
vaguely.</p>

<p>"What I've been telling you about," said the
foreman, aggrieved. "Where one of our workmen
was killed just now, blasting; that's his blood
what you're standing in," said he.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, she clung to his arm. "Take me
away," she whispered. "Oh, why does everything
turn horrible like this? It's like a horrible dream.
Let's get away. Give him something and let's
get away."</p>

<p>"It's not my fault," said the foreman, in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
injured tones. "She said she'd like to see it. I
wondered, at the time, but there's no accounting
for females, is there?"</p>

<p>They got away from the place&mdash;out of the
quarry and into the road. They found the stream
that flows from the waterfall under Snowdon, and
the flagged path that lies beside the stream. They
passed along it, she still clinging to his arm.
Presently a smooth, mossy rock invited them, and
before either of them knew it they were seated
there, side by side, and she was weeping on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He did not need her whispered words that broke
a long silence&mdash;"Thank God, you're safe"&mdash;to tell
him what he had to think, nor what, from that
hour, he had to live for.</p>

<p>"But, oh," she said at last, lifting her face from
his coat-sleeve, "what a horrible day! We've
struck a streak of horrible things. Let's go back
to the south, where things aren't like this."</p>

<p>"We'll go to-night, if you like," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, eagerly, "yes. But this
isn't the end. I feel there's something more
coming&mdash;I felt it at Chester. It wasn't only that
thing I couldn't tell you&mdash;something's going to
happen to separate us."</p>

<p>"Nothing can&mdash;but you," he said, hugging to
his heart all that her admission implied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel that something will," she said.</p>

<p>And he, for all that he laughed at her fears and
her predictions, with pride and joy swelling in his
heart till they almost broke the resolution of quiescence,
of waiting, of submitting his will to her
will, yet felt in those deep caves that lie behind the
heart, behind the soul, behind the mind of man,
the winds of coming misfortune blow chilly.</p>

<p>It was no surprise to either of them to find at
the hotel a telegram for Mrs. Basingstoke:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>Aunt Alice much worse. Please come at once.</p></div>

<p>It was signed with the name of the aunt whose
dog-cart had run over Charles, and beneath whose
legs Charles had experienced his miraculous resurrection
from death.</p>

<p>There was no reason to mistrust this telegram
as they had mistrusted the advertisement. But
she said to herself, "There! That's because of
what I said at Warwick."</p>

<p>They caught the last train to London that
night, and through the long, lamp-lit journey
Charles no longer lay between them. The white,
bullet head lay on her lap&mdash;but on her other side
was Edward, and her shoulder and his touched all
the way, even as, on the journey to Warwick, he
had dreamed of their touching. They spoke
little; it seemed as though everything had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
said. Only when her head drooped against his
shoulder and he knew that she had fallen asleep
he felt no sense of daring, no doubts as to his rights
or her resentments when he passed his arm around
her and rested his chin on her soft hair, gazing
straight before him in the flickering half-light
while she slept&mdash;oh, dreams come true&mdash;upon his
breast.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LONDON</div>


<div class='cap'>IT was very late when they parted on the door-step
of the house in Hyde Park Square.</div>

<p>"I don't know how to let you go," he said, and
took both her hands, regardless of the cabman's
stony attention. "I shall just go back to my rooms
in Montague Street&mdash;Thirty-seven; I've written
it down for you. And, look here, I won't come and
see you and I won't bother you, but if you want
me I'll be there. You must just do what you
want to do."</p>

<p>What she wanted to do was to jump into the
waiting taxicab and go back with him into that
world of fine and delicate adventure where were
blue skies, gold sun, green leaves, the mystery of
mountains, the sparkle of water, and the velvet of
old lawns; and, for each in the soul of the other,
a whole world of unexplored wonder and delight.</p>

<p>What she said was: "Thank you. I will write
and tell you what happens. Good-by&mdash;oh, good-by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
I feel as though I ought to ask you to forgive
me."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said, "but&mdash;no&mdash;I
don't know; but you do understand that I couldn't
stay away when she asked for me. She's the only
person in the world, except you, that I&mdash;that
ever&mdash; Good-by!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation which, later,
in the recollection of it, thrilled them both. Then
the cabman had the satisfaction, such as it was,
of seeing one of his fares raise to his lips the fingers
of the other. Then the knocker sounded softly,
the heavy door opened and received her into a
warmly lamp-lit hall, closed again, and left him
alone.</p>

<p>When he reached Montague Street rain was falling
and a chill wind blew. He had not been expected
and his rooms were dusty and disheveled.
Intensely quiet, too; through the roar of London
far below one could almost hear the silence of
these deserted rooms where, day by day, while he
had been out in the beautiful bright world, the
dim dust had slowly settled down.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he lit a big
fire and carried his bedding out and spread it in
the growing glow and warmth. "I'm not going to
risk a cold in the head at this crisis of my affairs,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
he told himself, "even if she doesn't care&mdash;and
Heaven knows how she can! I needn't make
myself a ridiculous and disgusting object in her
eyes."</p>

<p>To the same end he set the kettle on the fire
and made hot coffee for himself. When, at last, he
turned into well-aired sheets he found that he could
not sleep.</p>

<p>"Confound the coffee!" he said, and tried to
attribute to that brown exotic elixir the desperate
sense of futility and emptiness which possessed
him. His mind assured him that there was nothing
the matter with him but coffee; but his heart
said: "You won't see her in the morning. You
won't spend the day with her to-morrow, nor the
next day, nor the next." And his heart cursed the
mock marriage and all the reservations and abstentions
that it demanded. "If she had been
really my wife&mdash;" If she had been really his wife
he would have called three times a day to know
how things were with her. He would have seen
her, held her hands, felt again the confiding droop
of her head on his shoulder. But as it was&mdash; She
had consented to the mock marriage, he knew,
because she did not desire to give him any rights,
not even the right to ring at her aunt's front door
and ask for Mrs. Basingstoke.</p>

<p>He fell asleep at last, and dreamed that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
had taken an unfurnished flat in a neolithic cave
and that he had killed a bear and was dragging it
home to show her. The bear seemed to be not
quite dead, for it was growling, and its weight on
his back awoke him, to find that Charles had
thought his master's shoulders a convenient site
for slumber. He sleepily had it out with Charles,
and when he slept again he dreamed that he and
she had decided to live in a captive balloon. She
was already installed, but he could find no ladder
long enough to reach her. She was laughing down
at him and showering pink rose-leaves on his up-turned
face when he woke to find Charles conscientiously
licking his ears. This time he found
energy to get up and put a closed door between
himself and Charles, and then he dreamed that he
had arranged to meet her under the clock at
Charing Cross Station, and that the Government
had just decided to establish uniformity in railway
stations, and had called every station Charing
Cross, and had, moreover, furnished each station
with six hundred and sixty-six clocks, which all
ticked louder than Big Ben. He awoke, and it was
morning, and there were no clocks ticking, but
from beyond the door came the measured thump-thump-thump
of Charles's tail on the floor of the
sitting-room. So all night he had dreamed of her,
yet never once seen her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I believed in omens&mdash;" he said, and rang,
to make known his return to the people of the
house.</p>

<p>While his sitting-room was being put in order
he went down to Covent Garden and came back
with his arms full of roses and white lilies, which
he set up in mugs and pots of Grès de Flandre and
old brass and green Bruges ware.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd only 'a' told me, sir," said his
landlady, kindly but aggrieved. "I wouldn't have
had you come home and find the place all of a
mess like this, not for a pound, I wouldn't. But
you never wrote nor nothing, and the dust it do
incriminate so. But if you're going out for the
day I'll make it all as clean as a whistle by this
evening. It's a twelve-hour job, so it is. If I'd
only known you was to be expected."</p>

<p>"But you didn't know," said Edward, "and it's
not going to be a twelve-hour job, but a two-hour
job. I'll go out for two hours, and when I come
back I sha'n't know the place, shall I? You'll
work like a good fairy. I know you."</p>

<p>"Go on with you, sir," she advised. "You will
have your joke."</p>

<p>"I was never more serious. You see, a lady
might call." He voiced in words what he had not
dared to voice in his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, if it's a lady," said the landlady&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
through the tired, ridged, gray, London face something
pretty and immortally young stirred and
sparkled&mdash;"<em>the</em> young lady, sir, if I might make
so bold?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, Mrs. Jilks," he said&mdash;"<em>the</em> lady.
If she comes before I come back&mdash;but I don't
think she will&mdash;beg her to wait and say I'll be
back by noon. Come on, Charles."</p>

<p>He went and sat in Regents Park and tried
to fancy himself once more in the deep peace of
the Welsh Hills till Charles had a difference of
opinion with a Cocker spaniel and dreams were
set to flight.</p>

<p>He went back, hoping against hope that he
might find her there. She was not there, nor did
she come. Why should she? In the middle of
the afternoon came a letter; it had no beginning.
It said:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>I had a stiff and stifling interview with my aunt&mdash;the one
Charles came to life under the knees of in the cart. She was
as horrid as any one could possibly be. She reproached me
for marrying a pauper, and said I'd better have stuck to the
piano-tuner unless you were he in disguise! I was as dumb
as a mule&mdash;indeed, I almost felt my ears beginning to lie
back, as mules' ears do when they've decided they aren't
going to, whatever it is. Presently I got it out of her that
Aunt Alice's attack is very serious. If she gets over it she's
to go to Switzerland; there's an old school friend out there
that she loves, and who wants frightfully to have her there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
So then I shall be able to come back, and we'll go out together
again and see the world. You won't worry about me,
will you? Because this house is quite the lap of. And you
know that I wouldn't have broken off our mock-wedding
tour for anything in the world except for her&mdash;because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but you know all that. Give my love to Charles.</p></div>

<p>"Yours sincerely" was crossed out, and a postscript
added:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>I don't know how to end this letter. I won't end it. I'll
just put something at the end to show that this isn't the end&mdash;of
our times together, I mean.</p>

<div class='center'>
(To be continued.)<br />
</div></div>

<p>He thought it the prettiest, wittiest ending in
the world.</p>

<p>His room was neat as a new pin, as Mrs. Jilks
had promised. The roses and the lilies made it
what Mrs. Jilks called a perfect bower. "Any one
could tell," she assured him, "that it was <em>the</em>
young lady you was expecting. Why, it's like a
wedding already! She's sure to come soon, sir,
and I'll have the kettle on the boil and make her
a nice cup of tea the minute she comes."</p>

<p>But she did not come, and he had the nice cup
of tea alone, unless you count Charles, who ate
seven large doughnuts&mdash;seven for sixpence&mdash;in
seven great gulps&mdash;with no resultant modification
of his natural high spirits. Another day went by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and another, and she did not come. Edward realized
that she would not come, and that he had
been a fool ever to half hope that she would.</p>

<p>He drugged the empty hours with shopping.
He wandered about London buying things&mdash;the
oddest things. He bought a pair of cut-crystal
lusters and the skin of a leopard, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier-mâché</i>
fire-screen and a string of amber beads six feet
long. He sent the amber to her in a sandalwood
box cunningly carved and inlaid with ivory and
ebony and silver. That was on the first day.
Her second letter thanked him for it:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>How did you know that yellow was my fortunate color?
I was born under the sign of the lion, so a fortune-teller told
me, so all yellow stones are lucky for me. I am so sorry that
you have to be in London in the summer. Wouldn't you
like to go into the country? Auntie is a little better.</p></div>

<p>So then he went out and bought the topaz
brooch that he had thought of buying when he
first saw it in that jolly little shop in Vigo Street.
And he sent her that with the topaz necklace he
had bought in Warwick.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>They are beautiful [she wrote] and I love them, but you are
not to be extravagant. I should like to write you a long
letter, but auntie gets restless if I'm not sitting beside her.
She's really getting better, but I'm afraid it will be several
weeks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and she keeps asking me not to leave her. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
wish I could ask you to come here, to see me. There are
lots of odd minutes, when she's asleep. But my other aunt
would certainly be hateful to you&mdash;and I couldn't stand that.</p></div>

<p>Again and again he asked himself why he had
promised, voluntarily promised, not to call at the
house. What had he been thinking of? He had
been thinking of her, of course; he had wanted to
make things easy for her. He had at least made
them very hard for himself. He missed her every
hour of the day; he would not have believed that
he could have missed anything so much.</p>

<p>The time crawled by; the hours were long and
the days interminable. Even buying things&mdash;a
luxury in which he allowed himself considerable
latitude&mdash;could not possess the empty spaces in
a life that had been filled with her presence.</p>

<p>And to her, moving gently in the curtained
stillness of the sick-room, among the medicine-bottles
and the apparatus of sickness as the rich
know it, holding the thin hand that came out of
a scented, soft bed to cling to hers, it seemed that
either this ordered quietude was a dream, or else
that nothing in the last few weeks was true, had
been true, could ever be true again. The escape,
the flight, the Medway days, the reckless mock
marriage, the life of fine and delicate adventure,
the blue sky, the green leaves, the mystery of
mountains, the sparkle of water, and the velvet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of old lawns, the constant and deepening comradeship
of a man of whose existence a month ago
she had not so much as dreamed&mdash;could these
be real&mdash;all these which she had renounced to
come to the sick woman who longed for her&mdash;had
these really been hers&mdash;could they ever be hers
again?</p>

<p>Suffering had broken down the consistent unselfishness
of a lifetime, and the aunt clung to her
as children cling, frightened in the dark. "You
won't leave me," she said, over and over again.
"Your husband won't mind. It won't be for
long."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll not leave you," she said, and
wondered at the thrill her aunt's words gave her
and the pang she felt as she uttered her own.</p>

<p>Every day while the aunt slept she crept away
and went out into the air&mdash;the first day into bright
sunshine which was unbearable; after that into
the quiet, lamp-lit dusk of the square at night.
The London night was so unlike night on the
Welsh Hills that it seemed a medium that could
not torment her with memories. Whereas the
sunshine was the same sunshine which had lain
like a benediction in that far country of delight.
The lilacs and snowberries in the square inclosure,
which were dried and dusty by day, borrowed from
the kindly twilight the air of fresh groves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
among their somber shadows she walked as in
some garden of dusky enchantments, where, alone
with her dreams and her memories, she could
weave, out of the past and the future, a web of
glory to clothe the cold walls of the empty room
which, she began to perceive, life without Edward
was, and must be.</p>

<p>It was on the third evening, as she stood, fumbling
with the key of the garden, she knew that
some one stood on the pavement just behind her,
and, turning sharply, was face to face with Mr.
Schultz.</p>

<p>He raised his hat and smiled at her; held out
a hand, even. She was child enough to put her
two hands behind her, and woman enough to
hope that he hated to see her do it. She was surprised
to find herself alert and alive to the interest
of the encounter; not afraid at all, only interested.
Gone was the panic terror which had overwhelmed
her in the Kenilworth dungeon. Anger and resentment
remained, but stronger than either was
curiosity, so she stood with her hands behind
her, looking at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said; "just as you like.
I want a few words with you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk to you," she said, and
locked the square gate again.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we walk around the garden once or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
twice?" he asked. "I know you don't want to
talk to me, but I want to talk to you. I'm sorry
if I upset you that day in the ruins, but it's nothing
to the way your dog upset me. I had to have
it cauterized, besides doing completely for the
only decent suit I had with me. Besides, you hit
me, you know, with your parasol. Come, don't
bare malice. I don't. Call it quits and open the
square door."</p>

<p>Now you may think it was quite easy for her
to turn her back on Mr. Schultz and go back to
her aunt's house, leaving him planted there, but
it was not really easy, because she wanted something
of the man, and if she turned her back with
sufficient firmness it might be that she would
never see him again. What she wanted was the
remission of the promise she had made him, unasked
and of her own initiative&mdash;the promise that
she would not tell Edward of that day in the
dungeon.</p>

<p>"I can't open the square gate for you," she
said. "If you've really anything to say, you can
say it here. I can spare you three minutes," she
added, conclusively.</p>

<p>"Then let's walk around outside the railings.
It's better than standing here; it won't look so
odd if any one comes along who knows you," he
said, and it seemed strange to her that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
have so much consideration for her. She was
pleased. Her soul was of the order that delights
to find others better than her mind had led her to
expect. There are people, as you know, to whom
it is always somewhat of a disappointment to find
that any one is not so black as their fancy painted
him. She turned and they walked slowly along
the pavement that encircles the railings of the
square garden.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, "you said you had something
to say to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, lots," he told her. "I was just trying to
think which to say first. You know you've upset
me a good deal. Oh, I forgive you, but it ought
to be mutual. Yes, I'll put that first&mdash;I want us
to forgive each other&mdash;forgive and forget and not
bear grudge."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, coldly. "I forgive you,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted her before she could make the
request that was on her lips. "That'll do," he
said. "Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to tell
you how it was that I acted like a fool. I admit
I acted like a fool," he added, handsomely. "I
don't suppose I shall ever see you again and I don't
want you to go on thinking me a perfect beast.
I'd rather you didn't, though I know I was one
that day, and I don't know why, but I would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
even if I'm never to set eyes on you again. Well,
you see, it's like this: I dare say it'll sound silly
to you, but even when I was at school I always
wanted to do something noble&mdash;romantic, you
know&mdash;rescuing ladies in distress, like Scott's
novels, and things like that. I know it's too
rotten for words, nowadays, what with machinery
and telegraphs and radium and things, but that's
what I used to think. And when I came up with
you on the Seaford Road with no hat on and your
poor little satin shoes all dusty and splitting, I
thought, by Jove! my boy, here's your chance!
And I did behave all right that day, didn't I?"</p>

<p>His voice was wistful, and she said, eagerly:
"You were very, very kind. No one could have
been nicer and more&mdash;more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Respectful, eh? Well, I meant to be. I felt
respectful; I do still. And you won't mind me
saying I felt like a knight and you were the lady.
I don't mean that you aren't a lady now, but you
see what I mean, and you can't blame me if I
thought it would all end in me and you being&mdash;well&mdash;you
and me living happy ever after, the same
as they do in books."</p>

<p>Enchanted by the revelation, she said, "Indeed,
I don't blame you," more earnestly than she
meant to do.</p>

<p>"Don't be too kind to me," he said, grimly. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
know it doesn't mean anything, but it puts a man
out. Well, then <em>he</em> came along, and you said he
was your brother, and anybody could see with
half an eye that he wasn't your brother; and I
felt I'd been made a fool of, a complete, particular,
first-class fool, and that put my back up. And I
saw that things don't happen like they do in
books. And I hadn't, somehow, thought you'd
say anything that wasn't true."</p>

<p>She felt her face burn, and realized for the first
time that in their brief and stormy acquaintance
he had not been the only one to blame, and that,
anyhow, it was she who had taken the first false
step.</p>

<p>"I oughtn't to have told you a lie," she said,
and added ingenuously, "especially after you'd
been so kind; but I didn't know what to do&mdash;it
seemed so difficult to explain." She could not
tell him how difficult, nor why.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," he said. "I should have
said the same myself. It wasn't exactly a lie.
It's a thing most people wouldn't make any bones
about, only I thought you were different, that's
all. And that was one of the things that made
me feel it was fair to hunt you down, if I could&mdash;tit
for tat, so to speak&mdash;and, besides, it was fun
trying to see what I <em>could</em> find out. Then there's
another thing I must tell you, I used to think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
would be fun to be other things out of books&mdash;highwaymen
and detectives and things&mdash;and I got
a lead when I saw you at Cookham. After that I
tracked you down like any old Sherlock Holmes,
and I'm afraid at Kenilworth I behaved more like
a highwayman than a respectable solicitor&mdash;for
that's what I am."</p>

<p>"That's forgiven and forgotten," she told him.</p>

<p>"Well, I tracked you to Warwick, and when I
saw your name in the visitors' book&mdash;Mr. and
Mrs. Basingstoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was, I assure you. Well, when I saw that I
didn't know what to think, but I saw, however it
was, it was all up with me; but I didn't want to
see it, so I followed you to Kenilworth, and got a
chance I didn't expect to behave like a cad and
an ass, and behaved like them. But I don't think
you know how pretty you are&mdash;and I didn't believe
you were married, and all the things I'd
thought while I was driving you to Tunbridge
came up into my head and turned themselves inside
out, somehow, and I felt what a fool I'd been,
and I lost my head. And then you told me you
wouldn't tell him, for fear he should hurt me; and
that's really what I came here to say. That's
what I can't stick. I can take care of myself. I
want you to tell him anything you like&mdash;see?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Here's my card&mdash;and he can write to me, and I'll
meet him anywhere he likes and let's see who's
the best man. To set out to be a knight and all
that, and end up with hiding behind a woman&mdash;and
you to be the woman&mdash;no, I really can't stick
it. So will you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell him everything," she said, "and he
won't want to see who's the best man, and I don't
want him to want it. And I don't want you to,
either. You were a very kind knight-errant&mdash;but
you weren't such a very good detective, or
you'd have found out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, if you'll promise to give up
wanting to find out who's the best man. Will
you?"</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you like as long as you don't
think I'm afraid of him, and don't let him think it,
either. I don't think much of him, and I don't
know whether you'll believe it, but it was that as
much as anything set me to the detective business.
I wanted to&mdash;to&mdash;I thought you wanted looking
after. And then I acted like a brute&mdash;but I won't
go on about that. Now tell me what it was I
didn't find out?"</p>

<p>She pulled a little pale-silk bag from her pocket
and took out a stiff folded paper and gave it to
him. By the light of the next gas-lamp he unfolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it; it was a long slip, partly printed, partly
written. It was, in fact, the "marriage certificate"
which had been obtained in order to quiet
her family and to make possible the romance and
adventure of the incredible honeymoon.</p>

<p>He glanced at it, folded it, and gave it back.
"Thank you," he said. "I don't want to try who's
the best man. He is. He's got you."</p>

<p>She could find nothing to say that should be at
once true and kind.</p>

<p>"So that's all over," he said, straightening his
shoulders. "There's only one thing more. You
remember I went out to see about the car at Tunbridge,
and I was rather a long time gone? Well,
I rushed into a shop and bought this. I meant to
throw it over Westminster Bridge as soon as I left
you&mdash;but now, will you take it for a wedding-present?
I'd like you to."</p>

<p>He fumbled at a spring, opened a case, and
showed a half-hoop of sapphires.</p>

<p>"But I can't! It's too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm <em>awfully</em> rich," he said, bitterly. "I've
come into my father's business at Canterbury. I
don't know what to do with my money, and the
thing didn't cost much, really, but it was the best
I could get. You believe that, don't you? And I
thought it might be the beginning of living happy
ever after, and I should like you to have it, just to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
show you really have forgiven me. You will,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't take the ring," she said, "but I wish
I could, and I thank you very much for wishing
me to have it&mdash;and for all your kindness and your
kind thoughts of me."</p>

<p>"But you won't take the ring. He said you
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"My confessor. You see, I'm a Catholic, and
I had to tell him about Kenilworth, and so I told
him the whole thing. If it hadn't been for him
I shouldn't have tried to tell you about it all and
get you to forgive me. I'm glad I did, though."</p>

<p>Then she understood, and ceased to wonder
how this man had got his poor, complicated, involved
little history straightened out to such a
convincing simplicity.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd have had the ring," he said
again, discontentedly. "I never know what to do
with my money."</p>

<p>"If I had a lot of money I'd go about the world
trying to be a real knight-errant&mdash;just looking out
for people who want things and don't ask for
them&mdash;poor, proud, self-respecting people, poor
schoolmasters and young men in shops who don't
have good times. There was a man in a book who
thought he was ill, and his doctor told him to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
one person a day with his money. He got cured
in no time; and you're not ill."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't know how to begin," he said.
"You could have shown me, but you won't. Look
here, don't go yet; stay a little and tell me how
to begin."</p>

<p>Walking around and around the railings of the
garden, she developed her thesis. They had been
walking together for an hour and a half before
they parted on her door-step, and at parting she
did give him her hand.</p>

<p>In the hall she stood a minute or two, thinking.
Then she slipped quietly out again and took an
omnibus to Museum Street, and from there
walked to Montague Street. She felt that the
only important thing was to see Edward, to clear
away the one cloud of concealment that lay between
them&mdash;no, not the only one. The other
was a very little thing; he, at least, had never
known that it was there.</p>

<p>But when she reached number 37 it showed no
light at any of its windows; only the basement
window and the fanlight above the door gave out
a dusky radiance. It seemed impossible to ring
the bell and be faced with the assurance that he
was not at home. So she walked slowly away.</p>

<p>And behind drawn curtains in the flower-scented,
flower-bright room Charles stirred restlessly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Edward, also restless, was saying, "I could almost
believe that she would come to-night, now. All
the rest of the time I have known in my heart that
she would not come, but now, for the first time, it
seems possible."</p>

<p>But the hours wore on and still he and the
flowers and Charles were alone together.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HURSTMONCEAUX</div>


<div class='cap'>THE sky was gray; gray mists veiled the sea
and wisps of sea-fog lay in the hollows of the
downs. The young morning had not yet decided
whether it meant to be, when it was a grown-up
day, a very wet day, when your umbrella is useless
and you give it up and make up your mind to
be wet through and change as soon as you get
home; or a very fine day, one of those radiant,
blazing days that are golden to the very end, days
when you almost forget it ever has rained, and
find it hard to believe that it will ever rain again.
It was one of those mornings whose development is
as darkly hid as the future of any babe smiling at
you from its cradle and defying you to foresee
whether it will grow up to be a great criminal or
a great saint. If you love the baby, and trim its
cradle with hopes and dreams, you will find it
hard to believe that the darling can grow up just
nobody in particular, like the rest of us.</div>

<p>To Edward, lying at his long length on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
short turf and looking out to the opalescent mist
that hid the sea, it was not possible to believe that
this day of all days could be anything but very
good or very bad. The elements must be for him
or against him, must help or hinder. That they
could be indifferent was unthinkable.</p>

<p>For this was the day of days, come, at last,
after weeks of a waiting that had not been patient,
the day when he should, indeed, and not in
dreams, see her again.</p>

<p>This was the thought, insistent, even in his
sleep, that had at last broken up that sleep, as a
trickle of water breaks up the embankment of a
reservoir, letting out the deep floods inclosed by
that barrier, the deep flood of pent-up longing
which sleep could no longer restrain from consciousness.</p>

<p>So he had got up and come out to look over the
sea and think of her.</p>

<p>Her letters made a bulge in his coat pocket; he
pulled them out&mdash;a fat little bundle secured by an
elastic band&mdash;and he read:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>It is strange that you should have been expecting to see
me just then, because just then I really had come as far as
the door of your house&mdash;only everything was dark except
for a murky star of gas that had been turned down in the
hall. So I told myself that you weren't there, and I didn't
want to be told so by any one else, and I went home. I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
your letter; I like it very, very much, but it makes me see
how stupid and selfish I have been to let you stay in London
in the summer-time, waiting all the time for some one who
never comes. And I want you to go away, right into the
country, and I'll write to you as soon as Aunt Alice goes
abroad. She is very, very much better. It won't be long
now. A week, perhaps? Two weeks? Go away where it
is green and glorious, and I shall think of you all the time
and wish myself where you are.</p>

<p>At first when I read your letter I thought that I must
see you just once before you go away. But now I see that
I won't see you. If I were to see you it would not really
make anything any easier. And nothing is very easy, as it
is. You understand, don't you?</p></div>

<p>He hoped he did understand. If he understood,
her letter meant the beginning of the end of the
incredible honeymoon. For he dared to read the
letter as he desired to read it, and where she had
written, "If I were to see you it would not really
make anything easier, and nothing is very easy,"
he had read, "If I were to see you I should find
it too hard to part from you again," and next
moment cursed himself for a presumptuous fool.
What was he that the gods should now and thus
renew to him an assurance that had once been
his for a few magic hours, in the wild night-rush
of a London-bound train, when the air was scented
with the roses of dreams and the lady of all dreams
slept upon his shoulder? For in those long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
lonely days, in his London lodging, that assurance
had dwindled, shriveled, faded to a maddening
incertitude; the whole splendid pageant
of his days had faded and shrunk to the pale substance
of a vision.</p>

<p>Presumptuous or not, foolish or wise, the meaning
which her letter might have revived his spirit,
as the sweet air of dawn revives a man who comes
out of a darkened prison to meet the waxing light
and the first twitter of the newly awakened birds.</p>

<p>He had written:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>I will go away&mdash;I will go away to the sea and wait there
for you. You are right, as always. If I am not to see you
it is less intolerable not to be near you. I hardly dare to
read in your letter what I wish you could have meant me to
read. But I warn you that when once I have you again I
shall never let you go.</p></div>

<p>She had not answered that, though she had
written every day, little, friendly, intimate notes,
telling him of every day's little happenings and
what were to be the happenings of the morrow.
She told him, at last, that the aunt was really
going, and when. She wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>The aunts are going to Scotland and I shall be left to see
Aunt Alice off, and then, when she is gone, I will write and
make an assignation with my friend and comrade, and we will
go back to the good, green country. It won't be all different,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
will it? People meet again after years and don't recognize
each other. I suppose they have been changing, changing a
little bit every day. Do you think we shall have changed&mdash;contrariwise?
You one way and I the other, I mean, so that
when we do meet we sha'n't be the same?</p></div>

<p>The last letter of all was the shortest. "Monday,"
it said at the top of its page, and then:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>Auntie leaves Folkestone to-morrow by the morning boat.
I will let you know where to find me. Would Thursday suit
you, in the afternoon?</p></div>

<p>He had felt no doubt as to that. Thursday
would not suit him&mdash;but Tuesday would&mdash;and not
the afternoon, but the morning. Had she really
thought that he would wait two days?</p>

<p>And now, lying on the turf, he read her letters
through and laid his face down on the last and
dreamed a little, with closed eyes; and when he
lifted his head again the mist had grown thin as a
bridal veil and the sun was plain to be seen, showing
a golden face above the sea, where a million
points of light gleamed like tinsel through a curtain
of gossamer. The air was warmer, the scent
of the wild thyme sweeter and stronger, and overhead,
in the gray that was growing every moment
clearer and bluer, the skylarks were singing again.</p>

<p>"I knew," said Edward, as he went down toward
the town where the smoke of the newly lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
fires rose straight from the chimneys&mdash;"I knew it
couldn't have the heart not to be fine, on this day
of all days."</p>

<p>He went back to his hotel and inspected once
more certain of the purchases he had made since
her decree had banished him from London. Resisting
a momentary impulse toward asceticism in
the matter of breakfast, as an outward and visible
testimony to the unimportance of material things
at such a time as this, he found himself at the
other end of the pendulum's swing, ordering just
such a meal as he would have ordered had she
been with him, and ate his grape-fruit and omelette
and delicately browned fish with thoughtful
appreciation, making of them a banquet in her
honor. He toasted her in the coffee, and, as he
ate, romance insisted that it was not himself, but
her man, whom he was treating to that perfectly
served breakfast; and common sense added, "Yes,
and no man's at his best if he's hungry." Before
he reached the marmalade he had come to regard
that impulse to tea and toast as a man might regard
a vanished temptation to alcoholic excess.</p>

<p>"A hungry man's only half a man&mdash;the bad-tempered
half," he said, lighting his first cigarette,
and strolling out into the sunny inn-yard,
where a hostler with a straw in his mouth was
busy with a bucket of water and a horse's legs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
a pleasanter man, Edward thought, than the
other man there, busy with oil and petrol and
cotton-waste and a very new motor-car.</p>

<p>"I wish motors had never been invented," he
told himself.</p>

<p>All the same, when the hour-glass of time had
let through the last grain of the space of their
separation, and a pale girl withdrew her eyes from
the speck of a boat growing smaller and smaller on
a sea that sparkled so brilliantly that you could
hardly look at it, and almost listlessly turned to
walk back alone to her hotel, she was confronted
with a very pale young man standing beside a
very new motor-car.</p>

<p>"You!" she said, and, as once before, the blood
rushed to her face, and his to his, answering.</p>

<p>This was the moment for which he had lived for
weeks&mdash;and they shook hands like strangers! She
was grave and cold. What would her first words
be?</p>

<p>"But I said Thursday," she said.</p>

<p>He looked like a criminal detected in a larceny.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> said Tuesday," he told her. "Do you mind?"</p>

<p>In his anticipations of this moment he had always
counted on a mutual wave of gladness in
their reunion, in which all doubts should be resolved
and all explanations be easy. Now, he
himself felt awkward as a school-boy. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
noted in her a quite inexplicable restraint and embarrassment,
although she was certainly saying
that she did not mind, and that it did not matter
at all.</p>

<p>"Where were you going?" he asked, mechanically,
just for something to say as they stood there
by the motor, jostled by all the people who had
been seeing other people off.</p>

<p>"To my hotel, to pack and to write to you, as I
said I would."</p>

<p>"Shall I go away and wait for the letter?" he
asked, feeling that tea and toast would have done
well enough.</p>

<p>"No. Don't be silly!" she said.</p>

<p>Now that the flush had died from her face he
saw that it was paler and thinner. She saw in him
a curious hardness. It was one of those moments
when the light of life has gone out and there is
nothing to be said that is not futile and nothing
to be done that is of any use.</p>

<p>"It's a new car!" she said. "Yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>She wore a silky, soft-brown, holland-colored
dress and a white hat with some black velvet
about it and a dark rose. A wine-colored scarf
fluttered about her, and in spite of her paleness
and thinness she was more beautiful than ever
and far more dear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you like the car?" he added, stupidly.</p>

<p>"Very much," she said, without so much as
glancing at it. She looked up. "Well, what are
we going to do?" she asked, almost crossly.</p>

<p>"Whatever you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" her voice was plaintive. "You must
have had <em>some</em> idea or you wouldn't have come to-day
instead of Thursday. Hadn't you any idea,
any scheme, any plan?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but it does not matter; I'll do
anything you say."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she said, "if you won't tell me your
plans&mdash;" and she sketched the gesture of one who
turns away and goes on her way alone.</p>

<p>"But I will," he said, quickly. Yet still he
spoke like a very stupid child saying a lesson
which it does not quite know. "I will tell you&mdash;I
thought if you liked the car we might just get
in and drive off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just anywhere," he said, and hastened to
add, "but I see now how silly it was. Of course I
ought to have written and explained. Surprises
are always silly, aren't they?"</p>

<p>And he felt as one who sits forlorn and feels the
cold winds blow through the ruined arches of a
castle in Spain. He had not read her letter as she
had meant him to read it. Everything was different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Perhaps, after all, she did not&mdash;never had&mdash;he
had deceived himself, like the fatuous fool
he was.</p>

<p>"I ought to have thought," he blundered. "Of
course you would not care to go motoring in that
beautiful gown&mdash;and that hat&mdash;that makes you
look like the Gardener's Daughter&mdash;'a sight to
make an old man young'"&mdash;he added, recovering a
very little&mdash;"and no coat! But I did buy a coat."</p>

<p>He leaned over and pulled out of the car a mass
of soft brown fur lined with ermine. "Though,
of course, it would have been better to ask you to
choose one&mdash;I expect it's all wrong," and he
heaved up the furry folds half-heartedly, without
looking at her. "I just thought you might not
have thought of getting one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." and his voice
trailed away into silence, a silence that hers did
not break.</p>

<p>Slowly she put out her hand and touched the
fur, still without speaking. Then he did look at
her, and suddenly the light of life sprang up again
and the world was illumined from end to end.
For her face that had been pale was pink as the
wild rose is pink, and her mouth that had been
sad was smiling; in her eyes was all, or almost
all, that he had hoped to see there when, at last,
after this long parting they should meet; and her
hand was stroking the fur as if she loved it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's the most beautiful coat in the world," she
said, and her voice, like her face, was transfigured.
She turned her shoulders to him that he might
lay the coat on them, slipped her arms into the
sleeves, and wheeled to confront him, her face
alight with a mingled tenderness and gaiety that
turned him, for a moment, faint and giddy.</p>

<p>"You really like it, Princess?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"I love it," she made answer; "and now, my
lord, will you take me in your nice new motor-car
to my unworthy hotel, that I may pay my miserable
bill and secure my despicable luggage? Even
a princess, you know, can't go to the world's end
without a pair of slippers, a comb, and a clean
pocket-handkerchief."</p>

<p>With that she was in the car, and he followed,
gasping, in the sudden wave of enchantment that
had changed the world. What had happened?
Why had she suddenly changed? How had the
cloud vanished? Whence had the cloud arisen?</p>

<p>His heart, or his vanity, or both, had been too
bruised by the sudden blow to recover all in a
minute. His brain, too, was stunned by the lack
of any reason in what had happened. Why had
she not been glad to see him? Why had she so
suddenly turned from a cold stranger to her very
self? What had worked the bad magic? Not,
surely, the sight of a friend two days before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
expected that sight? What had worked the good
magic? It was not thinkable that any magic at
all could be worked by a fur coat or even by the
foresight that had provided it. His mind busied
itself with such questions and felt no pain in
them because it knew that his heart held in reserve,
to be contemplated presently, the glorious
fact that the good magic had, somehow, been
wrought. But he would not call his heart into
court yet. So that it was in silence that he drove
through the steep streets. His own slight luggage
was already at the back of the car, and when hers
was added to it and they had left the town behind
he still said nothing but the few words needed to
such little matters as the disposing of the luggage
and the satisfying of the hotel porter.</p>

<p>And when all the tall, stuccoed houses were
left behind and they were rushing smoothly
through the fresh morning, with the green sea on
one side and the green marshland on the other,
still he did not speak and kept his eyes on the
white ribbon of road unrolling itself before him.
It was just as they passed the third Martello
tower that her hand crept under his arm. He
took his from the steering-wheel for a moment
to lay it on hers, and after that his heart had
its way, and the silence, though still unbroken,
was no longer the cloak for anxious questionings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
but the splendid robe of a tender, tremulous
joy.</p>

<p>They sped on; through Dymchurch, where the
great sea-wall is, and where the houses are built
lower than the sea, so that the high tide laps
against the sea-wall level with the bedroom windows
of the little houses that nestle behind its
strong shelter.</p>

<p>It was she who spoke then. "Isn't it a dear
little place?" she said. "Wouldn't you like to
live in a Martello tower? They have one beautiful
big room with a Norman-looking pillar in the
middle, and a down-stairs part for kitchens, and
an up-stairs, where the big gun is, that you could
roof in for bedrooms. I should like a Martello!
Don't you want to buy one? You know they
built them to keep out Napoleon&mdash;and the canal
as well&mdash;but no one uses them now. They just
keep fishing-nets in them and wheelbarrows and
eel-spears."</p>

<p>"Let's buy the haunted one," he said, and hoped
that his voice was steady, for it was not of haunted
towers that he desired to speak. "A soldier's
ghost walks there; the village people say 'it's one
of them there Roman soldiers that lived here when
them towers was built in old ancient Roman
times.'"</p>

<p>She laughed. "You know Dymchurch, then?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Isn't it nice when people know the same places?
Almost as nice as it is when they've read the same
books."</p>

<p>But the silence was not broken, only lifted.
Her hand crept a little farther into the crook of
his arm.</p>

<p>It was as they passed the spick-and-span white-painted
windmill at New Romney that he said:
"Don't you think it would be nicer to buy a windmill?
There are four stories to that, and you can
shift the top one around so that your window's
always away from the wind."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "we really ought to buy a
windmill."</p>

<p>The "we" lay warm at his heart until they
came near Rye that stands upon its hill, looking
over the marshes to the sea that deserted it so
many years ago.</p>

<p>"There's a clock in Rye church that Sir Walter
Raleigh presented to the town," he said, instructively.</p>

<p>"And Henry James lived there," said she.</p>

<p>"Shall we have lunch at the Mermaid Tavern?
Or would you rather have a picnic? I've
got a basket."</p>

<p>"How clever of you! Of course we'll have the
picnic. And it's quite early. How beautifully the
car is going!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Has she a name yet?"</p>

<p>"No. You must christen her."</p>

<p>"I should call her Time, because she flies so
fast."</p>

<p>"You'd have to particularize. All time doesn't
fly."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "ah, no! And she ought to
have a splendid sort of name, she is so magnificently
triumphant over space and time. Raleigh
would have called her the 'Gloriana.'"</p>

<p>"So will we," said he. And they left Rye behind,
and again the silence folded them round, and
still her hand lay close in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p>At Winchelsea she suddenly asked, "Where's
Charles?"</p>

<p>"Charles," he said, gravely, "is visiting my old
nurse. He is well and happy&mdash;a loved and honored
guest."</p>

<p>"The dear!" she said, absently. They were
nearing Hastings before he spoke again, almost in
a whisper, and this time what he said was what
he meant to say.</p>

<p>"Are you happy?" he asked.</p>

<p>And she said, "Yes!"</p>

<p>It was at Hurstmonceaux that they opened the
picnic basket&mdash;Hurstmonceaux, the great ruined
Tudor castle, all beautiful in red brick and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
stone. Less than a hundred years ago it was perfect
to the last brick of it. But its tall old twisted
red chimneys smoked. So a Hastings architect
was called in. "I cannot cure your smoky chimneys,
sir," said he, "but with the lead and some of
the bricks of your castle I can build you a really
comfortable and convenient modern house in the
corner of your park, and I pledge you my word as
an architect that the chimneys of the new house
sha'n't smoke." So he did, and they didn't. And
Hurstmonceaux was turned from a beautiful house
to a beautiful ruin, and no one can live there; but
parties of sightseers and tourists can be admitted
on Mondays and Thursdays for a fee of sixpence
a head, children half-price. All of which she read
to him from the <cite>Guide to Sussex</cite>, as they sat in the
grass-grown courtyard, where moss and wild
flowers have covered the mounds of fallen brick.</p>

<p>"But this isn't Monday or Thursday," she said.
"How did you get in?"</p>

<p>"You saw&mdash;with the big key, the yard of cold
iron. I got special leave from the owner&mdash;for
this."</p>

<p>"How very clever of you! How much better
than anything <em>I</em> could have arranged."</p>

<p>"Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley," he
said, drawing the cork of the Rüdesheimer. "I
do hope you <em>really</em> like lobster salad."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"And chicken and raspberries and cream, and
everything. I like it all&mdash;and our dining-room&mdash;it's
the most beautiful dining-room I ever had.
I only thought of a wood, or a field, or perhaps a
river, for Thursday."</p>

<p>"You did mean to have a picnic for Thursday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is much better. It's a better
place than I could have found, and besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It isn't Thursday."</p>

<p>When luncheon, a merry meal and a leisurely,
was over, they leaned against a fallen pillar and
rested their eyes on the beauty of green floor,
red walls, and the blue sky roofing all. And above
the skylarks sang.</p>

<p>"There's nothing between us now," he said,
contentedly&mdash;"no cloud, no misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "and I don't want there
ever to be anything between us. So I'm going to
tell you about Chester&mdash;the thing that worried me
and I couldn't tell. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," he said, grimly.</p>

<p>"Only you must promise you won't be angry."</p>

<p>"With you?" he asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you must try to
believe that it is true. No, of course not; I don't
mean you're not likely to believe what <em>I</em> say, but
what he said."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please," he pleaded, "I'm a patient man,
but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>So she told him the whole story of Mr. Schultz,
and, at the end, waited for him to give voice to
the anger that, from the very touch of his hand on
hers, she knew he felt. But what he said was:</p>

<p>"It was entirely my fault. I ought never to
have left you alone for an instant."</p>

<p>"You thought I was to be trusted," she said, a
little bitterly, "and I couldn't even stay where
you left me. But you do believe what he said?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to," he answered. "After all, he
needn't have said anything&mdash;and if <em>you</em> believe
it&mdash; Look here, let's never think of him or speak
of him again, will you? We agreed, didn't we,
that Mr. Schultz was only a bad dream, and
that he never really happened. And there's nothing
now between us at all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no concealments?"</p>

<p>"There's one," she said, in a very small voice,
"but it's so silly I don't think I <em>can</em> tell you."</p>

<p>"Try," said he. "I could tell of the silliest
things. And after that there's one more thing I
wish you'd tell me, if you can. You <em>are</em> happy,
aren't you? You are glad that we're together
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Oh yes!"</p>

<p>"And this morning you weren't?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I was, I was! It was only&mdash; That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the silly thing I want to tell you. But you'll
laugh."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a laughing matter to me."</p>

<p>"I know I was hateful."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;bewildering. I couldn't understand
why everything was all wrong and then, suddenly,
everything was all right."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I was detestable. I can't think how
I could. But, you see, I was disappointed. I
meant to arrange for you to meet me at some very
pretty place and I was going to have a very
pretty luncheon. I'd thought it all out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
it was exactly the same as yours, almost, only I
shouldn't have known the name of the quite-perfect
wine and, then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there you were, you
know, and I hadn't been able to make things nice
for you."</p>

<p>"Was that really all, my Princess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was all."</p>

<p>"But still I don't understand why everything
was suddenly all right."</p>

<p>"It was what you said. That made everything
all right."</p>

<p>"What I said?"</p>

<p>"You see, I meant it all to be as pretty as I
could make it, and I'd got a new dress, very, very
pretty, and a new hat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then you came
upon me, suddenly, in this old rag and last year's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
hat and scarf I only wore because aunty gave
them to me. And I felt caught, and defrauded,
and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and dowdy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Princess!"</p>

<p>"And then you said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you said you liked
my dress .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so, then, it did not matter."</p>

<p>It was then that he lifted her hand to hold it
against his face as once before he had held it, and
silence wrapped them around once more&mdash;a lovely
silence, adorned with the rustle of leaves and grass
and the skylark's passionate song.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>




<h2>XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE END</div>


<div class='cap'>THE memory of luncheon died away and the
picnic-basket, again appealed to, yielded tea.
They had explored the towers, and talked of
Kenilworth, the underground passages, and talked
of the round tower of Wales. And half their
talk was, "Do you remember?" and, "Have you
forgotten?" The early days of the incredible
honeymoon had been days of exploration, each
seeking to discover the secrets of that unknown
land, each other's mind and soul; this day of reunion
was one gladly given over to the contemplation
of the memories they had together amassed.
It was a day dedicated to the counting of those
treasures of memory which they now held in common,
treasures among which this golden day itself
would, all too soon, have to be laid aside to be, for
each of them, forever, the chief jewel of that
priceless treasury.</div>

<p>It was when they were repacking the picnic-basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
that they first noticed how the color had
gone out of the grass, that was their carpet, and
how the blue had faded from the sky, that was
their roof. The day had changed its mind, after
all. Having been lovely in its youth and glorious
in its prime, it had, in its declining hours, fallen a
prey to the grayest melancholy and was now very
sorry for itself indeed.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said she, "I do believe it's going to
rain."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke the first big tears of the dejected
day fell on the lid of the teapot.</p>

<p>"We must hurry," he said, briskly. "I can't
have my princess getting wet through and catching
cold in her royal head. Run for it, Princess!
Run to the big gateway!"</p>

<p>She ran; he followed with the basket, went out
to cover the seats of his car with mackintosh rugs
and put up the hood, and came back, dampish, to
discuss the situation. They told each other that
it was only a shower, that it couldn't possibly, as
they put it, have "set in." But it had; the landscape
framed in the arch of the gateway lost
color moment by moment, even the yellow of
the gorse was blotted and obscured; the rain,
which at first had fallen in a fitful, amateurish sort
of way, settled down to business and fell in gray,
diagonal lines, straight and sharp as ramrods.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it's getting late," he said, "and your
Highness will be hungry."</p>

<p>"We've only just had tea," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"Ah, but we've got some way to go," he told her.</p>

<p>"Where <em>are</em> we going?"</p>

<p>"I had thought," he said, "of going to a place
beyond Eastbourne; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my old nurse lives there.
She's rather fond of me; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she'll have gotten
supper for us. I thought you'd like it. It's a
farm-house, rather a jolly one, and then I thought,
if you liked, we could drive back to the Eastbourne
hotel by moonlight."</p>

<p>"That would have been nice."</p>

<p>"But there won't be any moonlight. Perhaps
we'd better go straight to the hotel."</p>

<p>"But your nurse will expect you."</p>

<p>"I can telegraph."</p>

<p>"But she'll be so disappointed."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I get a car that would shut up
and be weather-tight? The rain will drift under
that hood like the deluge."</p>

<p>She laughed. "A little rain won't hurt us."</p>

<p>"Your beautiful hat!"</p>

<p>"I'll tie my ugly scarf around my head and put
my beautiful hat under the rug. Come, don't
let us disappoint your old nurse. No! It's not
going to leave off; it's only taking breath to go
on harder than ever."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said afterward that never, in the memory
of the oldest inhabitant, had there been such
a storm of rain in those parts&mdash;rain without thunder,
rain in full summer, rain without reason and
without restraint. The rain drifted in, as he had
said it would, and abruptly a wild wind arose and
tore at the hood of the car, flapped her scarf in
her eyes, and whipped their faces with sharp,
stinging rain. He stopped at the village inn and
brought her out ginger-brandy in a little glass
shaped like a thistle-flower, "to keep the cold out."
Also he went into the post-office and bought
peppermint bull's-eyes, "to keep us warm," he
said. "How admirably fortunate that we both
like peppermint!" And the journey began in
earnest, up hills that were torrents, through hollows
that were ponds, where the water splashed
like a yellow frill from their wheels as they rushed
through it. One village street was like a river, and
the men were busy with spades, digging through
the hedge-banks channels by which the water
might escape into the flooded fields.</p>

<p>And so, along through Pevensey, where the great
Norman castle still stands gray and threatening,
through Eastbourne, like an ant-heap where the
ants all use umbrellas, and, at long last, out on to
the downs. Her hands were ice-cold with the rain
and the effort of holding mackintosh rugs about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
herself and him. Her hair was blown across her
eyes, the lash of rain was on her lips. Breathless,
laughing for the joy of the wild rush through wind
and water, they gained the top of Friston Hill,
where the tall windmill is, and the pond and the
sign-post and the small, gray, quiet church. And
here, as suddenly as it had begun, the rain ceased;
the clouds drifted away.</p>

<p>"As though some great tidy angel had swept
them up with his wings," said she.</p>

<p>The sea showed again, gray with chalk stolen
from the cliffs, and white with the crests of waves
left angry by the wind. Under the frowning purple
clouds in the west glowed a long line of sullen
crimson, and they went on along the down road
in the peace of a clear, translucent twilight.
Below them, in a hollow, shone lights from a
little house.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it somewhere here," she asked him,
"that you left me and I didn't stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "somewhere here."</p>

<p>And then they had reached the house&mdash;not so
little, either, when you came close to it&mdash;and there
were steady lights shining through the lower windows,
and, in the upper rooms, the fitful, soft
glimmer of firelight. The car stopped at the
wooden gate from which a brick path led to the
front door, hospitably open, showing gleams of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
brass and old mahogany in a wide hall paved with
black-and-white checkered marble.</p>

<p>He peeled the streaming waterproof from her
shoulders and gave her his hand for the descent.
Side by side they passed down the wet path between
dripping flower-beds, but at the threshold
he stepped before her, entered the house, and
turned to receive her.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" he said, caught her by the elbows,
and lifted her lightly over the threshold.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" she asked, breathless
and smiling through the drift of wet, disordered
tresses.</p>

<p>"It's an old custom for welcoming a princess,"
he said.</p>

<p>The old nurse came from the kitchen, rustling
in stiff print and white apron.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Edward, sir," she said, beaming,
"I never thought you'd come in all this rain, not
even when I got the telegraph. Nicely, ma'am,
thanking you kindly and hoping you're the same,"
she said, in answer to the greeting and the hand
that the girl offered. "And your good lady,
Master Edward, she must be wet through, but
I've got a lovely fire in her room, if you'll come
along with me, ma'am, and I'll bring up some hot
water in two ticks."</p>

<p>So now, after the wind and the rain and the car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the girl finds herself in a long, low, chintz-curtained
room where a wood fire burns on an open hearth
and a devoted nurse of his is pulling off wet shoes
and offering cups of tea and hot water.</p>

<p>"And are you quite sure there ain't nothing
more I can do for you, ma'am, for I'm sure it's a
pleasure?"</p>

<p>The girl, left alone at last, found herself wondering.
He must have felt very sure of her, surely,
to have brought her thus to his nurse, as if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as
if their marriage had been a real marriage, like
other people's.</p>

<p>"Well, and why shouldn't he be sure of me?"
she asked herself. "I'm sure of him, thank God!"</p>

<p>The appointments about her were so charming,
all so perfectly in keeping with one another and with
the room that held them, that she found herself
making a comfortable, complete, and ceremonious
toilette. She had with her, by a fortunate accident,
as she told herself, a dress of soft, cream-colored
India muslin, fine as gauze. But when she looked
at herself in the glass she said, "Too white .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
it's like a wedding-dress," and sought for some
color to mitigate the dress's bridal simplicity.
There was no scarf that quite stifled criticism, but
there was the Burmese coat, long and red, with
gold-embroidered hems a foot deep. She slipped
it over the white gown and was satisfied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>She thought of the morning when she had last
worn the Burmese coat, and "He liked the red
rose," she said, as she put it on. When she was
dressed she sat down in the great arm-chair before
the fire and rested, tasting the simple yet perfect
luxury of it all. She did not know how long she
sat there, and reverie had almost given place to
dreaming when a tap at the door aroused her.</p>

<p>She opened it. Edward stood there.</p>

<p>"Shall we go down to supper?" he said, exactly
as though they had been at a dance. And, indeed,
they might have been at a dance, as far as
their dress went, except that he wore a dinner-jacket
in place of the tail-coat which dances
demand.</p>

<p>He offered his arm, and she took it and they
went together down the shallow, wide, polished,
uncarpeted stairs on which the lamps from the
corridor above threw the shadows of the slender,
elegant balustrades.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful house!" she said. "And how
nice of you to make yourself pretty for supper!"</p>

<p>"Well, we had to change into something, and I
won't attack you with the obvious rejoinder. But
you'll let me say, won't you, that you're like a
princess in a fairy-tale? Did your fairy godmother
give you a hundred dresses at your christening,
each one more beautiful than the other?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"She gave me something," the girl answered&mdash;"a
secret amulet. It's invisible, but it brings me
good fortune. It's brought me here," she added,
"where everything is perfect. My room's lovely,
and those stuffed sea-gulls over there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing
else could have been absolutely right in that
recess. How odd that I never knew before how
much I loved stuffed sea-gulls," she added, meditatively.</p>

<p>He stopped in front of the sea-gulls. "I got
a ring for you at Warwick," he said, "only I didn't
dare to ask you to take it. Will you take it now?
The other one was the symbol of something you
didn't mean. Let this one stand for&mdash;whatever
you will."</p>

<p>Without a word she held out her hand, so he
set the diamond and crystal above the golden
circlet.</p>

<p>"I am a fairy princess," she said then. "No
one but a fairy princess ever had such a ring as
this. Thank you, my Prince."</p>

<p>With the word, planted on the hour like a flag,
they went on.</p>

<p>The dining-room was paneled with beech, gray
and polished. In the middle a round table spread
with silver and glass, white lawn and white roses,
shone like a great wedding-cake.</p>

<p>"Do you mind," he said, as he set the chair for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
her&mdash;"do you mind if we make it another picnic
and wait on ourselves? My old nurse was anxious
to get back to her babies&mdash;she's got five of them&mdash;so
I ran her down in the car."</p>

<p>"She lives in the village, then? I thought she
lived here."</p>

<p>"I thought the five children might be rather
too much for you, especially when you're so tired."</p>

<p>"But I'm not," she said, "and oh, what a pretty
supper!"</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn, wax candles shone
from Sheffield-plated candlesticks on table and
mantelpiece and gleamed reflected in china and
silver and the glass of pictures and bookcases. A
little mellow fire burned on the hearth.</p>

<p>"What a darling room!" she said, "and how all
the things fit it, every single thing, exactly right.
They couldn't go any other way, possibly."</p>

<p>"You told me they would," he said, "at Warwick.
I remember you told me they would fit in
if one only loved them and gave them the chance.
I drink to you, Princess; and I know sparkling
wine is extravagant; but to-day isn't every day,
and it's only Moselle, which is not nearly so expensive
as champagne, and much nicer."</p>

<p>Raising their glasses, they toasted each other.</p>

<p>"But I thought," she said, presently&mdash;"I thought&mdash;there
were to be no concealments."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more there are."</p>

<p>"But this isn't.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Isn't this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Surely that's
the bookcase you bought at Warwick&mdash;and these
chairs and those candlesticks."</p>

<p>"I own it, Princess; I would scorn to deceive
you."</p>

<p>"Then this is <em>your</em> house?"</p>

<p>"It is; just that."</p>

<p>"Only that? Is there nothing else that it is?
Wasn't it once my house, for a very little while?
Wasn't it here that you left me, that night when
I ran away and I met Mr. Schultz?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, I forgot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Of course I didn't meet any one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
mean when you came after me and found me at
Tunbridge Wells. Oh! Suppose you hadn't found
me!"</p>

<p>"How am I to suppose the impossible? You
couldn't be in the same world with me and I not
find you. Yes, you are right, as always; this is
the house. Did you ever try bananas with chicken?
Do! They rhyme perfectly."</p>

<p>"Don't seek to put me off with bananas. Was
the house yours when you brought me here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had just bought it. All concealment is
really at an end now. And I am rather glad I did
buy it, because this is certainly better than the
coffee-room of an inn, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"How proud he is of his house! And well he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
may be! And when did he arrange all this beautiful
furniture?"</p>

<p>"When she banished him from London. It
was something to do; and she does like it?"</p>

<p>"She does indeed. Have you furnished it all?"</p>

<p>"Not nearly all. I wanted your advice about
the other parlor and the housekeeper's room and&mdash;oh,
lots of things. Yes, you are quite right in the
surmise which I see trembling on those lips. Mrs.
Burbidge is going to be our housekeeper. She's
staying at old nurse's, ready to come in whenever
she's wanted. If any one else decides to keep
house for me she can be sewing-maid, or still-room
maid, or lady-in-waiting to the hen-roost."</p>

<p>"I see," she said, crumbling bread and looking
at him across the glass and the silver and the white
flowers. "So this was the house! When I was in
the straw nest you made me I never thought the
house could be like this. I imagined it damp and
desolate, with strips of torn paper&mdash;ugly patterns&mdash;hanging
from the wall, and dust and cobwebs
and mice, perhaps even a rat. I was almost sure
I heard a rat!"</p>

<p>"Poor, poor little princess."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will!" she said, suddenly, answering a
voice that was certainly not his. "I don't care
what you say, I <em>will</em> tell him. Edward, when I
ran away it wasn't only because I didn't want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
be a burden and all that&mdash;though that was true,
too&mdash;the real true truth was that I was frightened.
Yes, I was! I shivered in that straw nest and listened
and listened and listened, and held my
breath and listened again, and I was almost sure
I heard something moving in the house; and it was
so velvet-dark, and I had to get up every time I
wanted to strike a match, because of not setting
fire to the straw, and at last there were only four
matches left. And I kept thinking&mdash;suppose something
should come creeping, creeping, very slowly
and softly, through the darkness, so that I shouldn't
know it until it was close to me and touched me!
I couldn't bear it&mdash;so I ran away. Now despise
me and call me a coward."</p>

<p>But he only said, "My poor Princess, how could
I ever have left you alone for a moment?" and
came around the table expressly to cut just the
right number of white grapes for her from the
bunch in the silver basket. Being there, his hand
touched her head, lightly, as one might touch the
plumage of a bird.</p>

<p>"How soft your hair is!" he said, in a low
voice, and went back to his place.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, "Let's clear away,"
she said, "it won't look so dismal for your nurse
when she comes in the morning."</p>

<p>"Let me do it," said he. "Why should you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, but I want to," she said. "And I want to
see the kitchen."</p>

<p>And the kitchen was worth seeing, with its rows
of shining brasses, its tall clock, its high chintz-flounced
mantelpiece. When all was in order,
when the table shone bare in its bright, dark mahogany,
he mended the fire, for the evening was
still chill with the rain, and drew up the big chair
for her to the hearth she had just swept. He stood
a moment looking down at her.</p>

<p>"May I sit at your feet, Princess?" he asked.</p>

<p>She swept aside her muslin and her gold embroideries
to make a place for him. The house was
silent, so silent that the crackle of the wood on the
hearth seemed loud, and louder still the slow ticking
of the tall clock on the other side of the wall.
Outside not a breath stirred, only now and then
came the tinkle of a sheep-bell, the sound of a
hoof on the cobblestones of the stable across the
yard, or the rattle of the ring against the manger
as some horse, turning, tossed his head.</p>

<p>He leaned back against her chair and threw his
head back until he could look at her face. The
tips of her fingers touched his forehead lightly
and his head rested against her knee; and now he
could not see her face any more. Only he felt
those smooth finger-tips passing across his brow
with the touch of a butterfly caress.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you happy?" he said, once again and very
softly.</p>

<p>And once again she answered, "Yes!"</p>

<p>Her hand ceased its movement and lay softly
on his hair. His hand came up and found her
other hand. For a long time neither spoke.
Then suddenly she said, "What is it?" for she
had felt the tiniest movement of the head her
hand rested on, a movement that told her he had
been about to speak and had then thought, "Not
now, not yet."</p>

<p>So she said, "What is it?" because she had a
secret, and she feared that he knew it.</p>

<p>Then he did speak. He said: "I have something
to tell you; I hope you will forgive me. I
must tell you now. Ah! let your hand lie there
while I tell you. Princess, I have deceived you.
If I did not think you would forgive me, I don't
think I could tell you, even now."</p>

<p>"I could forgive you anything," she said, so low
that he hardly knew he heard it.</p>

<p>"It is this," he said. "That marriage of ours&mdash;that
mock marriage&mdash;ah, try to forgive me for
deceiving you! It was a real marriage, my dear;
I tricked you into a real marriage. It seemed to
be the only way not to lose you. It was a real
marriage. You are my wife."</p>

<p>The clock ticked on in the kitchen, the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
crackled on the hearth, far on the down a sheep-bell
tinkled and was still. He sat there, immobile,
rigid, like a statue of a man, his heart beating a
desperate tune of hope and fear. Could she forgive
him? Dared he hope it? This moment, so
long foreseen, held terrors he had not foretold for
it. Was it possible that this deceit of his should
come between them, even now? He almost held
his breath in a passion of suspense, and the moments
fell past slowly, slowly. He could bear it
no longer. He sprang up, walked across the room,
came back, leaned on the mantelpiece so that she
could not see his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Princess, oh, my dearest!" he said, brokenly,
"don't say that you can't forgive me."</p>

<p>She, too, had risen and stood beside him. Now
she laid her hand on his shoulder. "It's not that,"
she said. "I don't know how to tell you. I've
nothing to forgive&mdash;unless you have, too."</p>

<p>He turned to meet her eyes, and they fell before
his.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward," she said, with a little laugh that
was half tears, "don't look like that! My dear,
I knew it all the time."</p>

<p>And there they were, clinging to each other
like two children saved from a shipwreck.</p>

<p>"You knew?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"Of course I knew," she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>They drew back to let their eyes meet in that
look of incredulous gladness that lovers know
when, at last, all barriers are down and true love
meets true love without veils or reservations.</p>

<p>"Thank God for this day," he said, reverently.</p>

<p>And at that a thunderous clamor at the house-door
broke in on their dream, a clatter and a
clangor, a rattling of chains and a volley of resonant
reverberatory barks.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Charles!" he cried. "How could
he know I was here?"</p>

<p>How, indeed? For it was indeed Charles, incredibly
muddy and wet, bounding round in the
room the moment the doors were opened, knocking
over a chair, clattering the fire-irons, and
coming to heavy anchor, with all four feet muddy,
on the edge of her white gown.</p>

<p>"I must go and chain him up in the stable," he
said, when Charles had been fed with the remains
of the supper. "You won't be afraid to
be left alone in the house, Princess, dear?"</p>

<p>"I sha'n't be afraid now," she said, caressing
Charles's bullet head. "You see, it's all different
now. How could I be afraid in my own home?"</p>
